        The questions on this test measure your knowledge and understanding of science.
        The test has two parts. Both parts are contained in this test booklet.
        Part I consists of 35 multiple-choice questions. Record your answers to these ques-
        tions on the separate answer sheet. Use only a No. 2 pencil on your answer sheet.
        Part II consists of 37 open-ended questions. Write your answers to Part II in the
        space provided in this test booklet.
        You may use a calculator to answer the questions on the test if you wish.
        You will have two hours to answer the questions on this test.

             DIRECTIONS
             There are 35 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by four choices,
             numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the correct
             answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
             question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have cho-
             sen.
             Read the sample question below:
                                                   Sample Question
                                           Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
             The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look
             at the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice num-
             ber 2 is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has
             been filled in.
             Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
             question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
             Then mark the answer you want.
             You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out
             your answers to the questions.
             You may use a calculator if needed.
             When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work care-
             fully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
             When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II.

                 Manatees are mammals that live in the warm, clear water environment of Florida’s shal-
             low rivers. They are large, peaceful, gentle, curious creatures and slow-moving swimmers.
             They spend many hours each day feeding on water plants. Manatees must surface to
             breathe every 15 minutes.
                 The manatee’s environment is changing because of hotels and homes being built along
             Florida’s rivers, and the change is affecting them in a negative way. Noise and activity from
             people and boats scare them. Manatees can be seriously injured by powerboat propellers
             because the manatees cannot tell the direction from which the boats are coming. The
             water plants the manatees use for food are being destroyed. As a result of these and other
             changes in their surroundings, manatees are on the endangered species list and may one
             day be gone from Florida’s rivers.

     rivers. [2]
