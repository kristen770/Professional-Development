Grade 8 Science Ð June Õ19 [3] [OVER]Part IDIRECTIONSThere are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by four choices, numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the 

best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each 
question by Þ lling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
Read the sample question below.
Sample QuestionEarth gets most of its light from(1) the stars
(2) the Sun

(3) the Moon

(4) other planets
The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2 is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been Þ lled in.Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each 
question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your Þ rst mark completely. 

Then mark the answer you want.You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your 
answers to the questions.You may use a calculator if needed.

When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work carefully 
and answer all of the questions in Part I.When you have Þ nished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

Grade 8 Science Ð June Õ19 [3] [OVER]Part IDIRECTIONSThere are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by four choices, numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the 

best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each 
question by Þ lling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
Read the sample question below.
Sample QuestionEarth gets most of its light from(1) the stars
(2) the Sun

(3) the Moon

(4) other planets
The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2 is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been Þ lled in.Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each 
question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your Þ rst mark completely. 

Then mark the answer you want.You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your 
answers to the questions.You may use a calculator if needed.

When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work carefully 
and answer all of the questions in Part I.When you have Þ nished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

 of science. The map shows the location of Mount Pinatubo, a volcano in the Philippines. The dark area represents the direction and location of the volcanic ash that spread out over the next several months following 
its eruption. Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted in 1991. During the eruption, ash particles 

were spread high into the atmosphere, and eventually circled the globe. The ash particles 
produced pollution that affected the climate and human health. Over time, the particles 
blocked some of the SunÕs energy from reaching Earth.

Grade 8 Science Ð June Õ19 [27] [OVER]Base your answers to questions 74 and 75 on the table below and on your knowledge of science. The table shows Mohs hardness scale, which is commonly used to identify minerals. The softest mineral, talc, has a value of 1. The hardest mineral, diamond, has a value of 10. The approximate hardnesses of some common objects 
are listed next to Mohs scale.Mohs Hardness Scale

the mineral.   [1]
Grade 8 Science Ð June Õ19 [28]Base your answers to questions 76 and 77 on the diagram below and on your knowledge of science. The diagram represents a cross section of exposed rock layers A through F that contain fossils. The rock layers have not been overturned.ABCDEF76 Identify the letter of the layer that contains the oldest fossil. Explain why you selected that layer.   [

Grade 8 Science Ð June Õ19 [30]Base your answers to questions 81 through 83 on the information and map below, and on your knowledge
 of science. The map shows the location of Mount Pinatubo, a volcano in the Philippines. The dark area represents the direction and location of the volcanic ash that spread out over the next several months following 
its eruption. Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted in 1991. During the eruption, ash particles 

were spread high into the atmosphere, and eventually circled the globe. The ash particles 
produced pollution that affected the climate and human health. Over time, the particles 
blocked some of the SunÕs energy from reaching Earth.
