            DIRECTIONS
            There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by four choices,
            numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the
            best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
            question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
            Read the sample question below.
                                                   Sample Question
                                            Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
            The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
            the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2
            is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been filled
            in.
            Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
            question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
            Then mark the answer you want.
            You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
            answers to the questions.
            You may use a calculator if needed.
            When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work carefully
            and answer all of the questions in Part I.
            When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

38 The plastic straws were placed under the wooden block to
    (1) decrease the mass of the block
    (2) decrease the amount of friction
    (3) increase the surface area of the ramp
    (4) increase the gravitational attraction of the block
39 The ramp would be classified as which type of simple machine?
    (1) a lever                                                  (3) a wheel and axle
    (2) a pulley                                                 (4) an inclined plane

     Base your answers to questions 81 through 83 on the information and map below, and on your knowledge
of science. The map shows the location of Mount Pinatubo, a volcano in the Philippines. The dark area
represents the direction and location of the volcanic ash that spread out over the next several months following
its eruption.
                   Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted in 1991. During the eruption, ash particles
            were spread high into the atmosphere, and eventually circled the globe. The ash particles
            produced pollution that affected the climate and human health. Over time, the particles
            blocked some of the Sun’s energy from reaching Earth.
