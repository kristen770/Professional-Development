                                        Science Standards for Alaska
Introduction
Science and technology have been essential to the people for Alaska in its past, its present, and will be increasingly important in the future.
Providing a firm foundation in science education for all students in Alaska is a bright opportunity and essential challenge. The State’s science
standards provide the foundation for defining what students should know and be able to do in terms of scientific knowledge and skills.
Development Process
In October of 2017, the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development (DEED) began a statewide application process to identify
teachers, principals, curriculum directors, science specialists, and other qualified individuals to serve as writers and reviewers and aid in the
creation of new science standards for the State of Alaska.
Out of the pool of applicants, 15 diverse professionals were selected based upon merit, to serve on the science content standards Writing
Committee. An additional 15 individuals were chosen to review the writing committee’s recommendations.
The Writing Committee was provided with the following charge:
    •    The Writing Committee will identify and review influential sets of science content standards (e.g., Next Generation Science Standards;
         standards for the NAEP, PISA, and TIMSS assessments; science standards from College Board and ACT; standards from other leading
         states; science standards from leading textbook publishers; and past science standards such as AAAS’ Project 2061).
    •    The Writing Committee will identify, modify, write, and compile a recommended set of science content standards drawing on its
         members’ expertise and review of relevant materials. Ideally, the Writing Committee will produce a set of content standards to guide
         curriculum and instruction in the state. In addition, the Writing Committee will provide recommendations regarding the state
         summative assessment in science.
    •    The Writing Committee will receive feedback from the Review Committee. Following review, the Writing Committee will make
         appropriate changes. The Writing Committee will send its recommended set of science content standards to the Alaska Department of
         Education and Early Development, which will review and send to the State Board.
In April of 2018, the first meeting of the Writing Committee was held in Anchorage. From this review, the team decided to use the Next
Generation Science Standards (NGSS) as a basis for Science Standards for Alaska due to its three-dimensional design, and focus on science for all
students. The three-dimensional design provides students with a context for the content of science, how science knowledge is acquired and
understood, and how the individual sciences are connected through concepts that have universal meaning across disciplines.
                                                                                                                                                  4


It was the committee’s decision to shape the Science Standards for Alaska around the NGSS, with a strong focus on relevance to Alaskan
students and allow educators the flexibility to determine the best way to help students meet the standards, based on local needs.
Following the first meeting, Writing Committee suggestions were sent to Reviewers for questions and comments. The Writing Committee met
again in June of 2018 to discuss reviewers’ input and revise the standards based on the feedback received.
Subsequently the Writing Committee’s revisions went back to the Review Committee for a second round of review. The Reviewers’ comments
were again presented to the Writing Committee in October of 2018.
In October of 2018, the Writing Committee met again, reviewed comments of the Review Team, and finalized recommendations regarding the
Science Standards for Alaska, to be submitted to the Alaska Board of Education for review and adoption.
Relation of the Science Standards for Alaska and the NGSS
The Science Standards for Alaska are largely the same as the NGSS. The Writing Committee strongly supported the general architecture and
approach of the NGSS, and made no changes to the scientific content. The revisions made by the Writing Committee included:
    •    Adding many examples of how the standards could be made more relevant for students in Alaska by showing applications of scientific
         principles and skills in an Alaskan context
    •    Rephrasing several content standards statements to make them clearer and/or more age-appropriate
    •    Fewer than a handful of NGSS content standards were combined, moved to a different grade, or deleted.
The Science Standards for Alaska contain two main parts: Performance Expectations and Foundational Statements. These are also found in the
NGSS. In addition, the NGSS standards have a third part, called “Connections” that provide information for how the science content standards
are related to each other and to other widely-used content standards in reading, writing, and mathematics. The Writing Committee
recommended not incorporating the Connections information as a part of the state-adopted science content standards because such
connections are likely to change more rapidly than the science standards. The Writing Committee endorsed DEED providing such information,
along with other support materials as supplemental to the actual state science standards.
                                                                                                                                             5


How to Read the Science Standards for Alaska1
The Science Standards for Alaska are distinct from prior science standards in three essential ways.
     1) Performance. Prior standards documents listed what students should “know” or “understand.” These ideas needed to be translated into
          performances that could be assessed to determine whether or not students met the standard. Different interpretations sometimes
          resulted in assessments that were not aligned with curriculum and instruction. The Science Standards for Alaska has avoided this
          difficulty by developing performance expectations that state what students should be able to do in order to demonstrate that they have
          met the standard, thus providing the same clear and specific targets for curriculum, instruction, and assessment.
     2) Foundations. Each performance expectation incorporates all three dimensions from the Framework— a science or engineering practice,
          a disciplinary core idea, and a crosscutting concept. The symbol “ ” indicates foundational statements are continued onto the next
          page.
     3) Coherence. Each set of performance expectations lists connections to other ideas within the disciplines of science and engineering, and
          with Common Core State Standards in Mathematics and English Language Arts.
This chapter describes how these three unique characteristics are embodied in the format of the standards, beginning with the “system
architecture.”
The Framework: A Vision For Science K-12
Science, engineering, and technology permeate nearly every facet of modern life and hold the key to solving many of humanity’s most pressing
current and future challenges, The United States’ position in the global economy is declining, in part because U.S. workers lack fundamental
knowledge in these fields. To address the critical issues of U.S. competitiveness and to better prepare the workforce, A Framework for K-12
Science Education proposes a new approach to K-12 science education that will capture students’ interest and provide them with the necessary
foundational knowledge in the field.

System Architecture
As shown in the illustration below, each set of performance expectations has a title. Below the title is a box containing the performance
expectations. Below that are three foundation boxes, which list (from left to right) the specific science and engineering practices (SEPs),
disciplinary core ideas (DCIs), and crosscutting concepts (CCCs) that were combined to produce the performance expectations (PEs) above.
These sections are described in further detail below.
                                                                                                                                            7


Performance Expectations (PEs)
The Science Standards for Alaska are expressed as Performance Expectations.
Performance Expectations are statements about what students should know and be able to do at the end of instruction. Each performance
expectation combines the practices of science and engineering, the disciplinary core ideas, and the cross cutting concepts into a single statement
of what is to be assessed. These are the elements of Three Dimensional Learning.
The Performance Expectations in the Science Standards for Alaska are targets for assessment. For students to achieve such performances, they
will need regular opportunities to engage in learning that blends all three dimensions of the standards throughout their classroom experiences,
from Kindergarten through High School. The performance expectations set the learning goals for students, then students, teachers, and districts
decide how to reach those learning targets.
When instruction is consistent with the Framework and the NGSS, students will be actively engaged in the full range of scientific and engineering
practices and applying the crosscutting concepts in the context of investigating multiple core ideas.
In three-dimensional learning student work is driven by questions arising from phenomena or by an engineering design problem. Students are
supported in connecting their learning across units and courses to build a coherent understanding of science ideas and of the crosscutting
concepts.
Students have opportunities to apply their developing science knowledge to explain phenomena or design solutions to real world problems.
They interact with others as they conduct investigations; represent data; interpret evidence; gather additional information, and develop
explanations, models, and arguments.
The Science Content Standards for Alaska are for all students, and all students are expected to achieve proficiency with respect to all of the
performance expectations in the Alaska standards.
The Science Content Standards for Alaska provide a foundation for rigorous advanced courses in science or engineering that some students may
choose to take. Students interested in pursuing science further (through Advanced Placement or other advanced courses) should have the
opportunity to do so.
                                                                                                                                                 8


In the example below, notice how the performance expectation combines the practices and ideas that students need to learn, while it suggests
ways of assessing whether or not third graders have the capabilities and understandings specified in the three foundation boxes.
2-PS1-2
Students who demonstrate understanding can: Analyze data obtained from testing different materials to determine which materials have the
properties that are best suited for an intended purpose.*
Clarification Statement: Examples of properties could include, strength, flexibility, hardness, texture, and absorbency.
Assessment Boundary: Assessment of quantitative measurements is limited to length.
The performance expectations above were developed using the following elements from the NRC document A Framework for K-12 Science Education.
        Science and Engineering Practices                              Disciplinary Core Ideas                                Crosscutting Concepts

                                                                                                               Influence of Engineering, Technology, and
                                                                                                               Science, on Society and the Natural World
                                                                                                               • Every human-made product is designed
                                                                                                                    by applying some knowledge of the
                                                                                                                    natural world and is built using materials
                                                                                                                    derived from the natural world.
As in this example, the performance expectations marked with an asterisk* integrate traditional science content with engineering through a
practice or disciplinary core idea. (https://www.nextgenscience.org)
As shown in the example, most of the performance expectations are followed by one or two additional statements. These include Clarification
Statements, which supply examples or additional clarification to the performance expectations including connections to Alaskan phenomena
where applicable; and Assessment Boundary Statements, which specify the limits to large-scale assessment.
                                                                                                                                                               9


The codes for the performance expectations were derived from the Framework. As with the titles, the first digit indicates a Grade Level from
Kindergarten to Grade 5. Middle School and High School Performance Expectations are organized by Grade Bands. Middle School (MS) is Grades
6-8, and High School (HS) is Grades 9-12. The next alpha-numeric code specifies the discipline, core idea and sub-idea. All of these codes are
shown in the table below, derived from the Framework. Finally, the number at the end of each code indicates the order in which that statement
appeared as a DCI in the Framework. Connections to the Nature of Science concepts can be found in either the practices or crosscutting
concepts foundation boxes.
Foundation Boxes
While the performance expectations can stand alone, a more coherent and complete view of what students should be able to do comes when
the performance expectations are viewed in tandem with the contents of the foundation boxes that lie just below the performance
expectations. These three boxes include the science and engineering practices, disciplinary core ideas, and crosscutting concepts, derived from
the Framework, that were used to construct this set of performance expectations.
Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs). The blue box on the left includes just the science and engineering practices used to construct the
performance expectations in the box above. These statements are derived from and grouped by the eight categories detailed in the Framework
to further explain the science and engineering practices important to emphasize in each grade band. Most sets of performance expectations
emphasize only a few of the practice categories; however, all practices are emphasized within a grade band. Teachers should be encouraged to
utilize several practices in any instruction, and need not be limited by the performance expectation, which is only intended to guide assessment.
The Science and Engineering Practices include:
     •       Asking questions and defining problems
     •       Developing and using models
     •       Planning and carrying out investigations
     •       Analyzing and interpreting data
     •       Using Mathematics and computational thinking
     •       Constructing explanations and designing solutions
     •       Engaging in argument from evidence
     •       Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information
The “Practices of Science and Engineering” replace the use of science processes or skills, to reflect the knowledge that is specific to each
practice, along with particular skills.

Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs). The orange foundation box in the middle of the Performance Expectation sample includes statements taken from
the Framework about the most essential ideas in the major science disciplines that all students should understand during 13 years of school.
Including these detailed statements was very helpful to the NGSS writing team as they analyzed and “unpacked” the disciplinary core ideas and
sub-ideas to reach a level that is helpful in describing what each student should understand about each sub-idea at the end of grades 2, 5, 8, and
12. Although they appear in paragraph form in the Framework, here they are bulleted to be certain that each statement is distinct.
The number of core ideas has been reduced in the Science Standards for Alaska to allow a deeper look into each concept and develop a strong
foundation of knowledge regarding these ideas. The Framework lists 11 core ideas, four in life science, four in physical science, and three in
Earth and Space Science. The core ideas are divided into a total of 39 sub-ideas, and each sub-idea is elaborated in a list of what students should
understand about that sub-idea at the end of grades 2, 5, 8, and 12. We have called these grade-specific statements Disciplinary Core Ideas
(DCIs).

Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs). The green box on the right of the sample Performance Expectation (PE), includes statements derived from the
Framework’s list of Crosscutting Concepts, which apply to one or more of the performance expectations in the box above. Most sets of
Performance Expectations limit the number of crosscutting concepts so as to focus on those that are readily apparent when considering the
Disciplinary Core Ideas. However, all are emphasized within a grade band. Again, the list is not exhaustive nor is it intended to limit instruction.
Using Crosscutting Concepts to Engage Students. In three-dimensional learning, crosscutting concepts are the dimension that provides a
scaffold upon which teachers and students can organize the cognitive structures for unifying the science disciplines. The crosscutting concepts
are featured as one of the three dimensions in the performance expectations outlining what students should know and be able to do.
The Crosscutting Concepts include big ideas in science such as:
    •        Patterns
    •        Cause and Effect
    •        Scale, Proportion, and Quantity
    •        Systems and Systems Models
    •        Energy and Matter
    •        Structure and Function
    •        Stability and Change
The Crosscutting Concepts can be used to discuss phenomena, evidence, and questions students develop during investigations or data analysis.
Prompts for using the Crosscutting Concepts can be located on this website.
                                                                                                                                                    12


KINDERGARTEN
The performance expectations in kindergarten help students formulate answers to questions such as: “What happens if you push or pull an
object harder? Where do animals live and why do they live there? What is the weather like today and how is it different from yesterday?”
Kindergarten performance expectations include PS2, PS3, LS1, ESS2, ESS3, and ETS1
Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework. Students are expected to develop understanding of patterns and variations in local weather
and the purpose of weather forecasting to prepare for, and respond to, severe weather. Students are able to apply an understanding of the
effects of different strengths or different directions of pushes and pulls on the motion of an object to analyze a design solution. Students are also
expected to develop understanding of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive and the relationship between their needs and
where they live.
The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; systems and system models; interdependence of science, engineering, and technology;
and influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural world are called out as organizing concepts for these
disciplinary core ideas. In the kindergarten performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency in
asking questions, developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, designing solutions,
engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. Students are expected to use these practices
to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

K. Forces and Interactions: Pushes and Pulls
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
K-PS2-1
    Plan and conduct an investigation to compare the effects of different strengths or different directions of pushes and pulls on the motion
    of an object. [Clarification Statement: Examples of pushes or pulls could include a string attached to an object being pulled, a person
    pushing an object, a person stopping a rolling ball, and two objects colliding and pushing on each other.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment
    is limited to different relative strengths or different directions, but not both at the same time. Assessment does not include non-contact
    pushes or pulls such as those produced by magnets.]
K-PS2-2
    Analyze data to determine if a design solution works as intended to change the speed or direction of an object with a push or a pull.*
    [Clarification Statement: Examples of problems requiring a solution could include having a marble or other object move a certain distance,
    follow a particular path, and knock down other objects. Examples of solutions could include tools such as a ramp to increase the speed of the
    object and a structure that would cause an object such as a marble or ball to turn.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include
    friction as a mechanism for change in speed.]

FIRST GRADE
The performance expectations in first grade help students formulate answers to questions such as: “What happens when materials vibrate?
What happens when there is no light? What are some ways plants and animals meet their needs so that they can survive and grow? How are
parents and their children similar and different? What objects are in the sky and how do they seem to move?” First grade performance
expectations include PS4, LS1, LS3, and ESS1
Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework. Students are expected to develop understanding of the relationship between sound and
vibrating materials as well as between the availability of light and ability to see objects. The idea that light travels from place to place can be
understood by students at this level through determining the effect of placing objects made with different materials in the path of a beam of
light. Students are also expected to develop understanding of how plants and animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and
meet their needs as well as how behaviors of parents and offspring help the offspring survive. The understanding is developed that young plants
and animals are like, but not exactly the same as, their parents. Students are able to observe, describe, and predict some patterns of the
movement of objects in the sky.
The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; structure and function; and influence of engineering, technology, and science on society
and the natural world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the first grade performance expectations,
students are expected to demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency in planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting data,
constructing explanations and designing solutions, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. Students are expected to use
these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

SECOND GRADE
The performance expectations in second grade help students formulate answers to questions such as: “How does land change and what are
some things that cause it to change? What are the different kinds of land and bodies of water? How are materials similar and different from one
another, and how do the properties of the materials relate to their use? What do plants need to grow? How many types of living things live in a
place?” Second grade performance expectations include PS1, LS2, LS4, ESS1, ESS2, and ETS1
Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework. Students are expected to develop an understanding of what plants need to grow and how
plants depend on animals for seed dispersal and pollination. Students are also expected to compare the diversity of life in different habitats. An
understanding of observable properties of materials is developed by students at this level through analysis and classification of different
materials. Students are able to apply their understanding of the idea that wind and water can change the shape of the land to compare design
solutions to slow or prevent such change. Students are able to use information and models to identify and represent the shapes and kinds of
land and bodies of water in an area and where water is found on Earth.
The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; energy and matter; structure and function; stability and change; and influence of
engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In
the second grade performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade- appropriate proficiency in developing and using
models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, constructing explanations and designing solutions, engaging in
argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. Students are expected to use these practices to
demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

THIRD GRADE
The performance expectations in third grade help students formulate answers to questions such as: “What is typical weather in different parts of
the world and during different times of the year? How can the impact of weather-related hazards be reduced? How do organisms vary in their
traits? How are plants, animals, and environments of the past similar or different from current plants, animals, and environments? What
happens to organisms when their environment changes? How do equal and unequal forces on an object affect the object? How can magnets be
used?” Third grade performance expectations include PS2, LS1, LS2, LS3, LS4, ESS2, and ESS3.
Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework. Students are able to organize and use data to describe typical weather conditions expected
during a particular season. By applying their understanding of weather-related hazards, students are able to make a claim about the merit of a
design solution that reduces the impacts of such hazards. Students are expected to develop an understanding of the similarities and differences
of organisms’ life cycles. An understanding that organisms have different inherited traits, and that the environment can also affect the traits that
an organism develops, is acquired by students at this level. In addition, students are able to construct an explanation using evidence for how the
variations in characteristics among individuals of the same species may provide advantages in surviving, finding mates, and reproducing.
Students are expected to develop an understanding of types of organisms that lived long ago and also about the nature of their environments.
Third graders are expected to develop an understanding of the idea that when the environment changes some organisms survive and reproduce,
some move to new locations, some move into the transformed environment, and some die. Students are able to determine the effects of
balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object and the cause and effect relationships of electric or magnetic interactions between
two objects not in contact with each other. They are then able to apply their understanding of magnetic interactions to define a simple design
problem that can be solved with magnets.
The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; scale, proportion, and quantity; systems and system models; interdependence of
science, engineering, and technology; and influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural world are called out as
organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the third grade performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-
appropriate proficiency in asking questions and defining problems; developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations,
analyzing and interpreting data, constructing explanations and designing solutions, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining,
evaluating, and communicating information. Students are expected to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

3. Forces and Interactions
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
3-PS2-1
    Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object.
    [Clarification Statement: Examples could include an unbalanced force on one side of a ball can make it start moving; and, balanced forces
    pushing on a box from both sides will not produce any motion at all.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to one variable at a time:
    number, size, or direction of forces. Assessment does not include quantitative force size, only qualitative and relative. Assessment is limited to
    gravity being addressed as a force that pulls objects down.]
3-PS2-2
    Make observations and/or measurements of an object’s motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion.
    [Clarification Statement: Examples of motion with a predictable pattern could include a child swinging in a swing, a ball rolling back and forth
    in a bowl, and two children on a see-saw.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include technical terms such as period and
    frequency.]
3-PS2-3
    Ask questions to determine cause and effect relationships of electric or magnetic interactions between two objects not in contact with
    each other. [Clarification Statement: Examples of an electric force could include the force on hair from an electrically charged balloon and
    the electrical forces between a charged rod and pieces of paper; examples of a magnetic force could include the force between two
    permanent magnets, the force between an electromagnet and steel paperclips, and the force exerted by one magnet versus the force
    exerted by two magnets. Examples of cause and effect relationships could include how the distance between objects affects strength of the
    force and how the orientation of magnets affects the direction of the magnetic force.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to forces
    produced by objects that can be manipulated by students, and electrical interactions are limited to static electricity.]

    Define a simple design problem that can be solved by applying scientific ideas about magnets.* [Clarification Statement: Examples of
    problems could include constructing a latch to keep a door shut and creating a device to keep two moving objects from touching each
    other.]

FOURTH GRADE
The performance expectations in fourth grade help students formulate answers to questions such as: “What are waves and what are some
things they can do? How can water, ice, wind and vegetation change the land? What patterns of Earth’s features can be determined with the use
of maps? How do internal and external structures support the survival, growth, behavior, and reproduction of plants and animals? What is
energy and how is it related to motion? How is energy transferred? How can energy be used to solve a problem?” Fourth grade performance
expectations include PS3, PS4, LS1, ESS1, ESS2, ESS3, and ETS1
Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework. Students are able to use a model of waves to describe patterns of waves in terms of amplitude
and wavelength, and that waves can cause objects to move. Students are expected to develop understanding of the effects of weathering or the
rate of erosion by water, ice, wind, or vegetation. They apply their knowledge of natural Earth processes to generate and compare multiple
solutions to reduce the impacts of such processes on humans. In order to describe patterns of Earth’s features, students analyze and interpret
data from maps. Fourth graders are expected to develop an understanding that plants and animals have internal and external structures that
function to support survival, growth, behavior, and reproduction. By developing a model, they describe that an object can be seen when light
reflected from its surface enters the eye. Students are able to use evidence to construct an explanation of the relationship between the speed of
an object and the energy of that object. Students are expected to develop an understanding that energy can be transferred from place to place
by sound, light, heat, and electric currents or from object to object through collisions. They apply their understanding of energy to design, test,
and refine a device that converts energy from one form to another.
The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; energy and matter; systems and system models; interdependence of science,
engineering, and technology; and influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural world are called out as organizing
concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the fourth grade performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-
appropriate proficiency in asking questions, developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting
data, constructing explanations and designing solutions, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating
information. Students are expected to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
4-PS3-1
    Use evidence to construct an explanation relating the speed of an object to the energy of that object. [Assessment Boundary: Assessment
    does not include quantitative measures of changes in the speed of an object or on any precise or quantitative definition of energy.]
4-PS3-2
    Make observations to provide evidence that energy can be transferred from place to place by sound, light, heat, and electric currents.
    [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include quantitative measurements of energy.]
4-PS3-3
    Ask questions and predict outcomes about the changes in energy that occur when objects collide. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on
    the change in the energy due to the change in speed, not on the forces, as objects interact. Examples may be at different scales, such as
    bouncing balls, car crashes, and plate tectonics (e.g., collisions of land to land, ice to ice, and ice to land).] [Assessment Boundary:
    Assessment does not include quantitative measurements of energy.]
4-PS3-4
    Apply scientific ideas to design, test, and refine a device that converts energy from one form to another.* [Clarification Statement:
    Examples of devices could include electric circuits that convert electrical energy into motion energy of a vehicle, light, or sound; and, a
    passive solar heater that converts light into heat. Examples of constraints could include the materials, cost, or time to design the device.]
    [Assessment Boundary: Devices should be limited to those that convert motion energy to electric energy or use stored energy to cause motion
    or produce light or sound.]
4-ESS3-1
    Obtain and combine information to describe that energy and fuels are derived from natural resources and their uses affect the
    environment. [Clarification Statement: Examples of renewable energy resources could include wind energy, water behind dams, tidal,
    geothermal, and sunlight; non-renewable energy resources are fossil fuels and fissile materials. Examples of environmental effects could
    include loss of habitat due to dams, loss of habitat due to surface mining, and air pollution from burning of fossil fuels.]

FIFTH GRADE
The performance expectations in fifth grade help students formulate answers to questions such as: “When matter changes, does its weight
change? How much water can be found in different places on Earth? Can new substances be created by combining other substances? How does
matter cycle through ecosystems? Where does the energy in food come from and what is it used for? How do lengths and directions of shadows
or relative lengths of day and night change from day to day, and how does the appearance of some stars change in different seasons?” Fifth
grade performance expectations include PS1, PS2, PS3, LS1, LS2, ESS1, ESS2, and ESS3
Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework. Students are able to describe that matter is made of particles too small to be seen through the
development of a model. Students develop an understanding of the idea that regardless of the type of change that matter undergoes, the total
weight of matter is conserved. Students determine whether the mixing of two or more substances results in new substances. Through the
development of a model using an example, students are able to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere
interact. They describe and graph data to provide evidence about the distribution of water on Earth. Students develop an understanding of the
idea that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water. Using models, students can describe the movement of matter
among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment and that energy in animals’ food was once energy from the sun. Students are
expected to develop an understanding of patterns of daily changes in length and direction of shadows, day and night, and the seasonal
appearance of some stars in the night sky.
The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; scale, proportion, and quantity; energy and matter; and systems and systems models
are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the fifth grade performance expectations, students are expected to
demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency in developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting
data, using mathematics and computational thinking, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating
information; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

MIDDLE SCHOOL PHYSICAL SCIENCES
Students in middle school continue to develop understanding of four core ideas in the physical sciences. The middle school performance
expectations in the Physical Sciences build on the K – 5 ideas and capabilities to allow learners to explain phenomena central to the physical
sciences but also to the life sciences and earth and space science. The performance expectations in physical science blend the core ideas with
scientific and engineering practices and crosscutting concepts to support students in developing useable knowledge to explain real world
phenomena in the physical, biological, and earth and space sciences. In the physical sciences, performance expectations at the middle school
level focus on students developing understanding of several scientific practices. These include developing and using models, planning and
conducting investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, using mathematical and computational thinking, and constructing explanations; and
to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas. Students are also expected to demonstrate understanding of several of
engineering practices including design and evaluation.
The performance expectations in the topic Structure and Properties of Matter help students to formulate an answer to the questions: “How can
particles combine to produce a substance with different properties? How does thermal energy affect particles?” by building understanding of
what occurs at the atomic and molecular scale. By the end of middle school, students will be able to apply understanding that pure substances
have characteristic properties and are made from a single type of atom or molecule. They will be able to provide molecular level accounts to
explain states of matters and changes between states. The crosscutting concepts of cause and effect; scale, proportion and quantity; structure
and function; interdependence of science, engineering, and technology; and influence of science, engineering and technology on society and the
natural world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In these performance expectations, students are expected
to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. Students use these
scientific and engineering practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
The performance expectations in the topic Chemical Reactions help students to formulate an answer to the questions: “What happens when
new materials are formed? What stays the same and what changes?” by building understanding of what occurs at the atomic and molecular
scale during chemical reactions. By the end of middle school, students will be able to provide molecular level accounts to explain that chemical
reactions involve regrouping of atoms to form new substances, and that atoms rearrange during chemical reactions. Students are also able to
apply an understanding of the design and the process of optimization in engineering to chemical reaction systems. The crosscutting concepts of
patterns and energy and matter are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In these performance expectations,
students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, analyzing and interpreting data, and designing solutions.
Students use these scientific and engineering practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
The performance expectations in the topic Forces and Interactions focus on helping students understand ideas related to why some objects will
keep moving, why objects fall to the ground and why some materials are attracted to each other while others are not. Students answer the
question, “How can one describe physical interactions between objects and within systems of objects?” At the middle school level, the PS2
Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework is broken down into two sub-ideas: Forces and Motion and Types of interactions. By the end of
                                                                                                                                               122


middle school, students will be able to apply Newton’s Third Law of Motion to relate forces to explain the motion of objects. Students also apply
ideas about gravitational, electrical, and magnetic forces to explain a variety of phenomena including beginning ideas about why some materials
attract each other while other repel. In particular, students will develop understanding that gravitational interactions are always attractive but
that electrical and magnetic forces can be both attractive and negative. Students also develop ideas that objects can exert forces on each other
even though the objects are not in contact, through fields. Students are also able to apply an engineering practice and concept to solve a
problem caused when objects collide. The crosscutting concepts of cause and effect; system and system models; stability and change; and the
influence of science, engineering, and technology on society and the natural world serve as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas.
In these performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in asking questions, planning and carrying out
investigations, and designing solutions, and engaging in argument; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
The performance expectations in the topic Energy help students formulate an answer to the question, “How can energy be transferred from one
object or system to another?” At the middle school level, the PS3 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework is broken down into four sub-
core ideas: Definitions of Energy, Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer, the Relationship between Energy and Forces, and Energy in
Chemical Process and Everyday Life. Students develop their understanding of important qualitative ideas about energy including that the
interactions of objects can be explained and predicted using the concept of transfer of energy from one object or system of objects to another,
and that that the total change of energy in any system is always equal to the total energy transferred into or out of the system. Students
understand that objects that are moving have kinetic energy and that objects may also contain stored (potential) energy, depending on their
relative positions. Students will also come to know the difference between energy and temperature, and begin to develop an understanding of
the relationship between force and energy. Students are also able to apply an understanding of design to the process of energy transfer. The
crosscutting concepts of scale, proportion, and quantity; systems and system models; and energy are called out as organizing concepts for these
disciplinary core ideas. These performance expectations expect students to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, planning
investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, and designing solutions, and engaging in argument from evidence; and to use these practices to
demonstrate understanding of the core ideas in PS3.
The performance expectations in the topic Waves and Electromagnetic Radiation help students formulate an answer to the question, “What are
the characteristic properties of waves and how can they be used?” At the middle school level, the PS4 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC
Framework is broken down into Wave Properties, Electromagnetic Radiation, and Information Technologies and Instrumentation. Students are
able to describe and predict characteristic properties and behaviors of waves when the waves interact with matter. Students can apply an
understanding of waves as a means to send digital information. The crosscutting concepts of patterns and structure and function are used as
organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. These performance expectations focus on students demonstrating proficiency in
developing and using models, using mathematical thinking, and obtaining, evaluating and communicating information; and to use these
practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

MIDDLE SCHOOL LIFE SCIENCES
Students in middle school develop understanding of key concepts to help them make sense of the life sciences. These ideas build upon students’
science understanding from earlier grades and from the disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts of
other experiences with physical and earth sciences. There are five life science topics in middle school: 1) Structure, Function, and Information
Processing, 2) Growth, Development, and Reproduction of Organisms, 3) Matter and Energy in Organisms and Ecosystems, 4) Interdependent
Relationships in Ecosystems, and 5) Natural Selection and Adaptations. The performance expectations in middle school blend core ideas with
scientific and engineering practices and crosscutting concepts to support students in developing useable knowledge across the science
disciplines. While the performance expectations in middle school life science couple particular practices with specific disciplinary core ideas,
instructional decisions should include use of many science and engineering practices integrated in the performance expectations. The concepts
and practices in the performance expectations are based on the grade-band endpoints described in A Framework for K-12 Science Education
(NRC, 2012).
The Performance Expectations in Structure, Function, and Information Processing help students formulate an answer to the question, “How do
the structures of organisms contribute to life’s functions?” Middle school students can plan and carry out investigations to develop evidence
that living organisms are made of cells and to determine the relationship of organisms to the environment. Students can use understanding of
cell theory to develop physical and conceptual models of cells. They can construct explanations for the interactions of systems in cells and
organisms and how organisms gather and use information from the environment. By the end of their studies, students understand that all
organisms are made of cells, that special structures are responsible for particular functions in organisms, and that for many organisms the body
is a system of multiple interacting subsystems that form a hierarchy from cells to the body. Crosscutting concepts of cause and effect, structure
and function, and matter and energy are called out as organizing concepts for these core ideas.
The Performance Expectations in Growth, Development, and Reproduction of Organisms help students formulate an answer to the question,
“How do organisms grow, develop, and reproduce?” Students understand how the environment and genetic factors determine the growth of an
individual organism. They also demonstrate understanding of the genetic implications for sexual and asexual reproduction. Students can develop
evidence to support their understanding of the structures and behaviors that increase the likelihood of successful reproduction by organisms.
They have a beginning understanding of the ways humans can select for specific traits, the role of technology, genetic modification, and the
nature of ethical responsibilities related to selective breeding. At the end of middle school, students can explain how selected structures,
functions, and behaviors of organisms change in predictable ways as they progress from birth to old age. Students can use the practices of
analyzing and interpreting data, using models, conducting investigations and communicating information. Crosscutting concepts of structure and
function, change and stability, and matter and energy flow in organisms support understanding across this topic.
                                                                                                                                                 154


The Performance Expectations in Matter and Energy in Organisms and Ecosystems help students formulate answers to the questions: “How do
organisms obtain and use matter and energy? How do matter and energy move through an ecosystem?” Middle school students can use
conceptual and physical models to explain the transfer of energy and cycling of matter as they construct explanations for the role of
photosynthesis in cycling matter in ecosystems. They can construct explanations for the cycling of matter in organisms and the interactions of
organisms to obtain the matter and energy from the ecosystem to survive and grow. Students have a grade-appropriate understanding and use
of the practices of investigations, constructing arguments based on evidence, and oral and written communication. They understand that
sustaining life requires substantial energy and matter inputs and the structure and functions of organisms contribute to the capture,
transformation, transport, release, and elimination of matter and energy. Adding to these crosscutting concepts is a deeper understanding of
systems and system models that ties the performances expectations in this topic together.
The Performance Expectations in Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems help students formulate an answer to the question, “How do
organisms interact with other organisms in the physical environment to obtain matter and energy? To answer the question, middle school
students construct explanations for the interactions in ecosystems and the scientific, economic, political, and social justifications used in making
decisions about maintaining biodiversity in ecosystems. Students can use models, construct evidence-based explanations, and use
argumentation from evidence. Students understand that organisms and populations of organisms are dependent on their environmental
interactions both with other organisms and with nonliving factors. They also understand the limits of resources influence the growth of
organisms and populations, which may result in competition for those limited resources. Crosscutting concepts of matter and energy, systems
and system models, and cause and effect are used by students to support understanding the phenomena they study.
The Performance Expectations in Natural Selection and Adaptations help students formulate answers to the questions: “How does genetic
variation among organisms in a species affect survival and reproduction? How does the environment influence genetic traits in populations over
multiple generations?” Middle school students can analyze data from the fossil record to describe evidence of the history of life on Earth and can
construct explanations for similarities in organisms. They have a beginning understanding of the role of variation in natural selection and how
this leads to speciation. They have a grade-appropriate understanding and use of the practices of analyzing graphical displays; using
mathematical models; and gathering, reading, and communicating information. The crosscutting concept of cause and effect is central to this
topic.

    Use an evidence-based argument to support an explanation for how characteristic behaviors and/or structures of organisms affect the
    probability of their successful reproduction. [Clarification Statement: Examples of behaviors that affect the probability of animal
    reproduction could include nest building and burrowing to protect young from cold, herding of animals to protect young from predators, and
    vocalization of animals and colorful plumage to attract mates for breeding. Examples of animal behaviors that affect the probability of plant
    reproduction could include transferring pollen or seeds, and creating conditions for seed germination and growth. Examples of plant
    structures could include bright flowers attracting butterflies that transfer pollen, flower nectar and odors that attract pollinators, and hard
    shells on nuts that squirrels bury.]
MS-LS1-5.
    Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for how environmental and genetic factors influence the growth of organisms.
    [Clarification Statement: Examples of local environmental conditions could include availability of food, light, space, and water. Examples of
    genetic factors could include large breed cattle and species of grass affecting growth of organisms. Examples of evidence could include
    drought decreasing plant growth, fertilizer increasing plant growth, different varieties of plant seeds growing at different rates in different
    conditions, and fish growing larger in large ponds than they do in small ponds. Alaskan examples include fish sizes/population in fresh vs. salt
    water or of varying water temperatures, deer size and color (Sitka blacktail deer), bear size and color.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment

MIDDLE SCHOOL EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCES
Students in middle school develop understanding of a wide range of topics in Earth and space science (ESS) that build upon science concepts
from elementary school through more advanced content, practice, and crosscutting themes. There are six ESS standard topics in middle school:
Space Systems, History of Earth, Earth’s Interior Systems, Earth’s Surface Systems, Weather and Climate, and Human Impacts. The content of the
performance expectations are based on current community-based geoscience literacy efforts such as the Earth Science Literacy Principles
(Wysession et al., 2012), and is presented with a greater emphasis on an Earth Systems Science approach. The performance expectations
strongly reflect the many societally relevant aspects of ESS (resources, hazards, environmental impacts) as well as related connections to
engineering and technology.
Space Systems: Middle school students can examine the Earth’s place in relation to the solar system, Milky Way galaxy, and universe. There is a
strong emphasis on a systems approach, using models of the solar system to explain astronomical and other observations of the cyclic patterns
of eclipses, tides, and seasons. There is also a strong connection to engineering through the instruments and technologies that have allowed us
to explore the objects in our solar system and obtain the data that support the theories that explain the formation and evolution of the universe.
History of Earth: Students can examine geoscience data in order to understand the processes and events in Earth’s history. Important concepts
in this topic are “Scale, Proportion, and Quantity” and “Stability and Change,” in relation to the different ways geologic processes operate over
the long expanse of geologic time. An important aspect of the history of Earth is that geologic events and conditions have affected the evolution
of life, but different life forms have also played important roles in altering Earth’s systems.
Earth’s Systems: Students understand how Earth’s geosystems operate by modeling the flow of energy and cycling of matter within and among
different systems. Students can investigate the controlling properties of important materials and construct explanations based on the analysis of
real geoscience data. Of special importance in both topics are the ways that geoscience processes provide resources needed by society but also
cause natural hazards that present risks to society; both involve technological challenges, for the identification and development of resources
and for the mitigation of hazards.
Weather and Climate: Students can analyze data, including maps, and construct and use models to develop understanding of the factors that
control weather and climate. A systems approach is also important here, examining the feedbacks between systems as energy from the sun is
transferred between systems and circulates though the ocean and atmosphere.
Human Impacts: Students understand the ways that human activities impacts Earth’s other systems. Students can use many different practices
to understand the significant and complex issues surrounding human uses of land, energy, mineral, and water resources and the resulting
impacts of their development.
                                                                                                                                                186

    Construct and explain, using evidence from rock strata, how the geologic time scale is used to organize Earth’s 4.6-billion-year-old history.
    [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how analyses of rock formations and the fossils they contain are used to establish relative ages of
    major events in Earth’s history. Examples of Earth’s major events could range from being very recent (such as the last Ice Age or the earliest
    fossils of homo sapiens) to very old (such as the formation of Earth or the earliest evidence of life). Examples can include the formation of
    mountain chains and ocean basins, the evolution or extinction of particular living organisms, or significant volcanic eruptions.] [Assessment
    Boundary: Assessment does not include recalling the names of specific periods or epochs and events within them.]
MS-ESS2-2
    Construct and present an evidence-based explanation of how geoscience processes have changed Earth’s surface at varying time and spatial
    scales. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how processes change Earth’s surface at time and spatial scales that can be large (such as slow
    plate motions or the uplift of large mountain ranges) or small (such as rapid landslides or microscopic geochemical reactions), and how many
    geoscience processes (such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and meteor impacts) usually behave gradually but are punctuated by catastrophic
    events. Examples of geoscience processes include surface weathering and deposition by the movements of water, ice, and wind. Emphasis is
    on geoscience processes that shape local geographic features, where appropriate. Alaskan examples should include locally significant
    landforms including coastal or ocean sea floor structures.]
MS-ESS2-3
    Analyze and interpret data on the distribution of fossils and rocks, continental shapes, and seafloor structures to provide evidence of the

MS. Weather and Climate
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
MS-ESS2-5
    Collect data to provide evidence for how the motions and complex interactions of air masses result in changes in weather conditions.
    [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how air masses flow from regions of high pressure to low pressure, causing weather (defined by
    temperature, pressure, humidity, precipitation, and wind) at a fixed location to change over time, and how sudden changes in weather can
    result when different air masses collide. Emphasis is on how weather can be predicted within probabilistic ranges. Examples of data can be
    provided to students (such as weather maps, diagrams, and visualizations) or obtained through laboratory experiments (such as with
    condensation).] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include recalling the names of cloud types or weather symbols used on weather
    maps or the reported diagrams from weather stations.]
MS-ESS2-6
    Develop and use a model to describe how unequal heating and rotation of the Earth cause patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation
    that determine regional climates. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how patterns vary by latitude, altitude, and geographic land
    distribution. Emphasis of atmospheric circulation is on the sunlight-driven latitudinal banding, the Coriolis effect, and resulting prevailing
    winds; emphasis of ocean circulation is on the transfer of heat by the global ocean convection cycle, which is constrained by the Coriolis effect
    and the outlines of continents. Examples of models can be diagrams, maps and globes, or digital representations.] [Assessment Boundary:
    Assessment does not include the dynamics of the Coriolis effect.]

    Ask questions to clarify evidence of the factors that have caused the rise in global temperatures over the past century. [Clarification
    Statement: Examples of factors include human activities (such as fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and agricultural activity) and
    natural processes (such as changes in incoming solar radiation or volcanic activity). Examples of evidence can include tables, graphs, and maps
    of global and regional temperatures and chemistry (both ocean and land surface), sea ice cover, permafrost, glacial change, atmospheric levels
    of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, food availability locally and worldwide, and the rates of human activities. Emphasis is on the

Students who demonstrate understanding can: Ask questions to clarify evidence of the factors that have caused the rise in global temperatures
over the past century.
Clarification Statement: Examples of factors include human activities (such as fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and agricultural
activity) and natural processes (such as changes in incoming solar radiation or volcanic activity). Examples of evidence can include tables, graphs,
and maps of global and regional temperatures and chemistry (both ocean and land surface), sea ice cover, permafrost, glacial change,
atmospheric levels of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, food availability locally and worldwide, and the rates of human activities.
Emphasis is on the major role that human activities play in causing the rise in global temperatures.

    mitigate their effects. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how some natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions and severe weather,
    are preceded by phenomena that allow for reliable predictions, but others, such as earthquakes, occur suddenly and with no notice, and
    thus are not yet predictable. Examples of natural hazards can be taken from interior processes (such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions),
    surface processes (such as mass wasting and tsunamis), or severe weather events (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods). Examples of
    data can include the locations, magnitudes, and frequencies of the natural hazards. Examples of technologies can be global (such as satellite
    systems to monitor hurricanes or forest fires) or local (such as building basements in tornado-prone regions or reservoirs to mitigate
    droughts). Alaskan examples should include but are not limited to tsunamis, storm surges, landslides, and earthquakes.]

    Statement: Examples of the design process include examining human environmental impacts, assessing the kinds of solutions that are
    feasible, and designing and evaluating solutions that could reduce that impact. Examples of human impacts can include water usage (such as
    the withdrawal of water from streams and aquifers or the construction of dams and levees), land usage (such as urban development,
    agriculture, or the removal of wetlands), and pollution (such as of the air, water, or land).]

HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICAL SCIENCES
Students in high school continue to develop their understanding of the four core ideas in the physical sciences. These ideas include the most
fundamental concepts from chemistry and physics, but are intended to leave room for expanded study in upper-level high school courses. The
high school performance expectations in Physical Science build on the middle school ideas and skills and allow high school students to explain
more in-depth phenomena central not only to the physical sciences, but to life and earth and space sciences as well. These performance
expectations blend the core ideas with scientific and engineering practices and crosscutting concepts to support students in developing useable
knowledge to explain ideas across the science disciplines. In the physical science performance expectations at the high school level, there is a
focus on several scientific practices. These include developing and using models, planning and conducting investigations, analyzing and
interpreting data, using mathematical and computational thinking, and constructing explanations; and to use these practices to demonstrate
understanding of the core ideas. Students are also expected to demonstrate understanding of several engineering practices, including design
and evaluation.
The performance expectations in the topic Structure and Properties of Matter help students formulate an answer to the question, “How can
one explain the structure and properties of matter?” Two sub-ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance expectations:
the structure and properties of matter, and nuclear processes. Students are expected to develop understanding of the substructure of atoms
and provide more mechanistic explanations of the properties of substances. Students are able to use the periodic table as a tool to explain and
predict the properties of elements. Phenomena involving nuclei are also important to understand, as they explain the formation and abundance
of the elements, radioactivity, the release of energy from the sun and other stars, and the generation of nuclear power. The crosscutting
concepts of patterns, energy and matter, and structure and function are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In
these performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, planning and conducting
investigations, and communicating scientific and technical information; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core
ideas.
The performance expectations in the topic Chemical Reactions help students formulate an answer to the questions: “How do substances
combine or change (react) to make new substances? How does one characterize and explain these reactions and make predictions about them?”
Chemical reactions, including rates of reactions and energy changes, can be understood by students at this level in terms of the collisions of
molecules and the rearrangements of atoms. Using this expanded knowledge of chemical reactions, students are able to explain important
biological and geophysical phenomena. Students are also able to apply an understanding of the process of optimization in engineering design to
chemical reaction systems. The crosscutting concepts of patterns, energy and matter, and stability and change are called out as organizing
concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In these performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing
                                                                                                                                                 214


and using models, using mathematical thinking, constructing explanations, and designing solutions; and to use these practices to demonstrate
understanding of the core ideas.
The Performance Expectations associated with the topic Forces and Interactions supports students’ understanding of ideas related to why some
objects will keep moving, why objects fall to the ground, and why some materials are attracted to each other while others are not. Students
should be able to answer the question, “How can one explain and predict interactions between objects and within systems of objects?” The
disciplinary core idea expressed in the Framework for PS2 is broken down into the sub ideas of Forces and Motion and Types of Interactions. The
performance expectations in PS2 focus on students building understanding of forces and interactions and Newton’s Second Law. Students also
develop understanding that the total momentum of a system of objects is conserved when there is no net force on the system. Students are able
to use Newton’s Law of Gravitation and Coulomb’s Law to describe and predict the gravitational and electrostatic forces between objects.
Students are able to apply scientific and engineering ideas to design, evaluate, and refine a device that minimizes the force on a macroscopic
object during a collision. The crosscutting concepts of patterns, cause and effect, and systems and system models are called out as organizing
concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the PS2 performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in planning
and conducting investigations, analyzing data and using math to support claims, and applying scientific ideas to solve design problems; and to
use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
The Performance Expectations associated with the topic Energy help students formulate an answer to the question, “How is energy transferred
and conserved?” The disciplinary core idea expressed in the Framework for PS3 is broken down into four sub-core ideas: Definitions of Energy,
Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer, the Relationship between Energy and Forces, and Energy in Chemical Process and Everyday Life.
Energy is understood as quantitative property of a system that depends on the motion and interactions of matter and radiation within that
system, and the total change of energy in any system is always equal to the total energy transferred into or out of the system. Students develop
an understanding that energy at both the macroscopic and the atomic scale can be accounted for as either motions of particles or energy
associated with the configuration (relative positions) of particles. In some cases, the energy associated with the configuration of particles can be
thought of as stored in fields. Students also demonstrate their understanding of engineering principles when they design, build, and refine
devices associated with the conversion of energy. The crosscutting concepts of cause and effect; systems and system models; energy and
matter; and the influence of science, engineering, and technology on society and the natural world are further developed in the performance
expectations associated with PS3. In these performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using
models, planning and carry out investigations, using computational thinking, and designing solutions; and to use these practices to demonstrate
understanding of the core ideas.
The Performance Expectations associated with the topic Waves and Electromagnetic Radiation are critical to understand how many new
technologies work. As such, this disciplinary core idea helps students answer the question, “How are waves used to transfer energy and send
and store information?” The disciplinary core idea in PS4 is broken down into Wave Properties, Electromagnetic Radiation, and Information
                                                                                                                                                 215


Technologies and Instrumentation. Students are able to apply understanding of how wave properties and the interactions of electromagnetic
radiation with matter can transfer information across long distances, store information, and investigate nature on many scales. Models of
electromagnetic radiation as either a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields or as particles are developed and used. Students understand
that combining waves of different frequencies can make a wide variety of patterns and thereby encode and transmit information. Students also
demonstrate their understanding of engineering ideas by presenting information about how technological devices use the principles of wave
behavior and wave interactions with matter to transmit and capture information and energy. The crosscutting concepts of cause and effect;
systems and system models; stability and change; interdependence of science, engineering, and technology; and the influence of engineering,
technology, and science on society and the natural world are highlighted as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the PS3
performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in asking questions, using mathematical thinking, engaging in
argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating and communicating information; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding
of the core ideas.

HIGH SCHOOL LIFE SCIENCES
Students in high school develop understanding of key concepts that help them make sense of life science. The ideas are building upon students’
science understanding of disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts from earlier grades. There are five
life science topics in high school: 1) Structure and Function, 2) Inheritance and Variation of Traits, 3) Matter and Energy in Organisms and
Ecosystems, 4) Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems, and 5) Natural Selection and Evolution. The performance expectations for high
school life science blend core ideas with scientific and engineering practices and crosscutting concepts to support students in developing useable
knowledge that can be applied across the science disciplines. While the performance expectations in high school life science couple particular
practices with specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional decisions should include use of many practices underlying the performance
expectations. The performance expectations are based on the grade-band endpoints described in A Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC,
2012).
The performance expectations in the topic Structure and Function help students formulate an answer to the question: “How do the structures
of organisms enable life’s functions?” High school students are able to investigate explanations for the structure and function of cells as the basic
units of life, the hierarchical systems of organisms, and the role of specialized cells for maintenance and growth. Students demonstrate
understanding of how systems of cells function together to support the life processes. Students demonstrate their understanding through
critical reading, using models, and conducting investigations. The crosscutting concepts of structure and function, matter and energy, and
systems and system models in organisms are called out as organizing concepts.
The performance expectations in the topic Inheritance and Variation of Traits help students in pursuing an answer to the question: “How are
the characteristics from one generation related to the previous generation?” High school students demonstrate understanding of the
relationship of DNA and chromosomes in the processes of cellular division that pass traits from one generation to the next. Students can
determine why individuals of the same species vary in how they look, function, and behave. Students can develop conceptual models for the
role of DNA in the unity of life on Earth and use statistical models to explain the importance of variation within populations for the survival and
evolution of species. Ethical issues related to genetic modification of organisms and the nature of science can be described. Students can explain
the mechanisms of genetic inheritance and describe the environmental and genetic causes of gene mutation and the alteration of gene
expression. Crosscutting concepts of structure and function, patterns, and cause and effect developed in this topic help students to generalize
understanding of inheritance of traits to other applications in science.
The performance expectations in the topic Matter and Energy in Organisms and Ecosystems help students answer the questions: “How do
organisms obtain and use energy they need to live and grow? How do matter and energy move through ecosystems?” High school students can
construct explanations for the role of energy in the cycling of matter in organisms and ecosystems. They can apply mathematical concepts to
develop evidence to support explanations of the interactions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration and develop models to communicate
                                                                                                                                                  254


these explanations. They can relate the nature of science to how explanations may change in light of new evidence and the implications for our
understanding of the tentative nature of science. Students understand organisms’ interactions with each other and their physical environment,
how organisms obtain resources, change the environment, and how these changes affect both organisms and ecosystems. In addition, students
can utilize the crosscutting concepts of matter and energy and Systems and system models to make sense of ecosystem dynamics.
The performance expectations in the topic Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems help students answer the question, “How do organisms
interact with the living and non-living environment to obtain matter and energy?” This topic builds on the other topics as high school students
demonstrate an ability to investigate the role of biodiversity in ecosystems and the role of animal behavior on survival of individuals and species.
Students have increased understanding of interactions among organisms and how those interactions influence the dynamics of ecosystems.
Students can generate mathematical comparisons, conduct investigations, use models, and apply scientific reasoning to link evidence to
explanations about interactions and changes within ecosystems.
The performance expectations in the topic Natural Selection and Evolution help students answer the questions: “How can there be so many
similarities among organisms yet so many different plants, animals, and microorganisms? How does biodiversity affect humans?” High school
students can investigate patterns to find the relationship between the environment and natural selection. Students demonstrate understanding
of the factors causing natural selection and the process of evolution of species over time. They demonstrate understanding of how multiple lines
of evidence contribute to the strength of scientific theories of natural selection and evolution. Students can demonstrate an understanding of
the processes that change the distribution of traits in a population over time and describe extensive scientific evidence ranging from the fossil
record to genetic relationships among species that support the theory of biological evolution. Students can use models, apply statistics, analyze
data, and produce scientific communications about evolution. Understanding of the crosscutting concepts of patterns, scale, structure and
function, and cause and effect supports the development of a deeper understanding of this topic.
                                                                                                                                                255

HS. Natural Selection and Evolution
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
HS-LS4-1.
    Communicate scientific information that common ancestry and biological evolution are supported by multiple lines of empirical evidence.
    [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on a conceptual understanding of the role each line of evidence has relating to common ancestry and
    biological evolution. Examples of evidence could include similarities in DNA sequences, anatomical structures, and order of appearance of
    structures in embryological development.]
HS-LS4-2.
    Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from four factors: (1) the potential for a
    species to increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3)
    competition for limited resources, and (4) the proliferation of those organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce in the
    environment. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on using evidence to explain the influence each of the four factors has on number of
    organisms, behaviors, morphology, or physiology in terms of ability to compete for limited resources and subsequent survival of individuals
    and adaptation of species. Examples of evidence could include mathematical models such as simple distribution graphs and proportional
    reasoning.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include other mechanisms of evolution, such as genetic drift, gene flow through
    migration, and co-evolution.]
HS-LS4-3.
    Apply concepts of statistics and probability to support explanations that organisms with an advantageous heritable trait tend to increase
    in proportion to organisms lacking this trait. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on analyzing shifts in numerical distribution of traits and
    using these shifts as evidence to support explanations.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to basic statistical and graphical
    analysis. Assessment does not include allele frequency calculations.]
HS-LS4-4.
    Construct an explanation based on evidence for how natural selection leads to adaptation of populations. [Clarification Statement:
    Emphasis is on using data to provide evidence for how specific biotic and abiotic differences in ecosystems (such as ranges of seasonal
    temperature, long-term climate change, acidity, light, geographic barriers, or evolution of other organisms) contribute to a change in gene
    frequency over time, leading to adaptation of populations.]

HS-LS4-5.
    Evaluate the evidence supporting claims that changes in environmental conditions may result in (1) increases in the number of individuals
    of some species, (2) the emergence of new species over time, and (3) the extinction of other species. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is
    on determining cause and effect relationships for how changes to the environment such as deforestation, fishing, pollution, erosion,
    permafrost thawing, changes in sea ice, invasive species, land level changes due to earthquakes, changes in ocean chemistry, sea level
    change, volcanic eruptions, drought, flood and the rate of change of the environment affect the distribution or disappearance of traits in
    species.

HS-LS4-2
Students who demonstrate understanding can: Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from
four factors: (1) the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a species due to mutation
and sexual reproduction, (3) competition for limited resources, and (4) the proliferation of those organisms that are better able to survive and
reproduce in the environment.
Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on using evidence to explain the influence each of the four factors has on number of organisms, behaviors,
morphology, or physiology in terms of ability to compete for limited resources and subsequent survival of individuals and adaptation of species.
Examples of evidence could include mathematical models such as simple distribution graphs and proportional reasoning.
Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include other mechanisms of evolution, such as genetic drift, gene flow through migration, and co-
evolution.

HIGH SCHOOL EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCES
Students in high school develop understanding of a wide range of topics in Earth and space science (ESS) that build upon science concepts from
middle school through more advanced content, practice, and crosscutting themes. There are five ESS standard topics in middle school: Space
Systems, History of Earth, Earth’s Systems, Weather and Climate, and Human Sustainability. The content of the performance expectations are
based on current community-based geoscience literacy efforts such as the Earth Science Literacy Principles (Wysession et al., 2012), and is
presented with a greater emphasis on an Earth Systems Science approach. There are strong connections to mathematical practices of analyzing
and interpreting data. The performance expectations strongly reflect the many societally relevant aspects of ESS (resources, hazards,
environmental impacts) with an emphasis on using engineering and technology concepts to design solutions to challenges facing human society.
Space Systems: High school students can examine the processes governing the formation, evolution, and workings of the solar system and
universe. Some concepts studied are fundamental to science, such as understanding how the matter of our world formed during the Big Bang
and within the cores of stars. Others concepts are practical, such as understanding how short-term changes in the behavior of our sun directly
affect humans. Engineering and technology play a large role here in obtaining and analyzing the data that support the theories of the formation
of the solar system and universe.
History of Earth: Students can construct explanations for the scales of time over which Earth processes operate. An important aspect of Earth
and space science involves making inferences about events in Earth’s history based on a data record that is increasingly incomplete that farther
you go back in time. A mathematical analysis of radiometric dating is used to comprehend how absolute ages are obtained for the geologic
record. A key to Earth’s history is the coevolution of the biosphere with Earth’s other systems, not only in the ways that climate and
environmental changes have shaped the course of evolution but also in how emerging life forms have been responsible for changing Earth.
Earth’s Systems: Students can develop models and explanations for the ways that feedbacks between different Earth systems control the
appearance of Earth’s surface. Central to this is the tension between internal systems, which are largely responsible for creating land at Earth’s
surface (e.g., volcanism and mountain building), and the sun- driven surface systems that tear down the land through weathering and erosion.
Students understand the role that water plays in affecting weather. Students understand chemical cycles such as the carbon cycle. Students can
examine the ways that human activities cause feedbacks that create changes to other systems.
Weather and Climate: Students understand the system interactions that control weather and climate, with a major emphasis on the
mechanisms and implications of climate change. Students understand the analysis and interpretation of different kinds of geoscience data allow
students to construct explanations for the many factors that drive climate change over a wide range of time scales.
Human Impacts: Students understand the complex and significant interdependencies between humans and the rest of Earth’s systems through
the impacts of natural hazards, our dependencies on natural resources, and the environmental impacts of human activities.

HS. Space Systems
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
HS-ESS1-1.
    Develop a model based on evidence to illustrate that the life span of the Sun is a function of nuclear fusion in its core, and that stars,
    through nuclear fusion over their life cycle, produce elements and release energy that eventually reaches Earth in the form of radiation.
    [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the way nucleosynthesis, and therefore the different elements created, varies as a function of the
    mass of a star and the stage of its lifetime. Emphasis is on the energy transfer mechanisms that allow energy from nuclear fusion in the sun’s
    core to reach Earth. Example applications include solar flares, auroras, the 11-year sunspot cycle and non-cyclic variations over centuries.]
    [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include details of the atomic and sub-atomic processes involved with nuclear fusion, or details of
    the many different nucleosynthesis pathways for stars of differing masses.]
HS-ESS1-2.
    Construct an explanation of the Big Bang theory based on astronomical evidence of light spectra, motion of distant galaxies, and
    composition of matter in the universe. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the astronomical evidence of the red shift of light from
    galaxies as an indication that the universe is currently expanding, the cosmic microwave background as the remnant radiation from the Big
    Bang, and the observed composition of ordinary matter of the universe, primarily found in stars and interstellar gases (from the spectra of
    electromagnetic radiation from stars), which matches that predicted by the Big Bang theory (3/4 hydrogen and 1/4 helium).]
HS-ESS1-4.
    Use mathematical or computational representations to predict the motion of orbiting objects in the solar system. [Clarification
    Statement: Emphasis is on Newtonian gravitational laws governing orbital motions, which apply to human-made satellites as well as planets
    and moons.] [Assessment Boundary: Mathematical representations for the gravitational attraction of bodies and Kepler’s Laws of orbital
    motions should not deal with more than two bodies, nor involve calculus.]

    include evidence of the ages oceanic crust increasing with distance from mid-ocean ridges (a result of plate spreading) and the ages of North
    American continental crust decreasing with distance away from a central ancient core of the continental plate (a result of past plate
    interactions).]
HS-ESS1-6.
    Apply scientific reasoning and evidence from ancient Earth materials, meteorites, and other planetary surfaces to construct an account of
    Earth’s formation and early history. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on using available evidence within the solar system to reconstruct
    the early history of Earth, which formed along with the rest of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. Examples of evidence include the
    absolute ages of ancient materials (obtained by radiometric dating of meteorites, moon rocks, and Earth’s oldest minerals), the sizes and
    compositions of solar system objects, and the impact cratering record of planetary surfaces.]

    continental and ocean-floor features. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how the appearance of land features (such as mountains,
    valleys, and plateaus) and sea-floor features (such as trenches, ridges, and seamounts) are a result of both constructive forces (such as
    volcanism, tectonic uplift, and orogeny) and destructive mechanisms (such as weathering, mass wasting, and coastal erosion).] [Assessment

spatial and temporal scales to form continental and ocean-floor features.
Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how the appearance of land features (such as mountains, valleys, and plateaus) and sea-floor features
(such as trenches, ridges, and seamounts) are a result of both constructive forces (such as volcanism, tectonic uplift, and orogeny) and
destructive mechanisms (such as weathering, mass wasting, and coastal erosion).

HS. Earth's Systems
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
HS-ESS2-2.
    Analyze geoscience data to evaluate claims that one change to Earth’s surface creates feedbacks that cause changes to other Earth
    systems. [Clarification Statement: Examples should include climate feedbacks, such as how an increase in greenhouse gases causes a rise in
    global temperature that melts glacial and sea ice, which reduces the amount of sunlight reflected from Earth’s surface, increasing surface
    temperatures and further reducing the amount of ice. Examples could also be taken from other system interactions, such as feedbacks due
    to the effects of permafrost thawing; how the loss of ground vegetation causes an increase in water runoff and soil erosion; how dammed
    rivers increase groundwater recharge and decrease sediment transport, and how the loss of wetlands causes a decrease in local humidity
    that further reduces wetland extent.]
HS-ESS2-3.
    Develop a model based on evidence of Earth’s interior to describe the cycling of matter by thermal convection. [Clarification Statement:
    Emphasis is on both a one-dimensional model of Earth, with radial layers determined by density, and a three-dimensional model, which is
    controlled by mantle convection and the resulting plate tectonics. Examples of evidence include maps of Earth’s three-dimensional structure
    obtained from seismic waves, records of the rate of change of Earth’s magnetic field (as constraints on convection in the outer core), and
    identification of the composition of Earth’s layers from high-pressure laboratory experiments.]
HS-ESS2-5.
    Plan and conduct an investigation of the properties of water and its effects on Earth materials and surface processes. [Clarification
    Statement: Emphasis is on mechanical and chemical investigations with water and a variety of solid materials to provide evidence for the
    connections between the hydrologic cycle and system interactions commonly known as the rock cycle. Examples of mechanical
    investigations include stream transportation and deposition using a stream table, beach erosion and deposition patterns in relation to
    substrate type and size, erosion using variations in soil moisture content, and frost wedging by the expansion of water as it freezes.
    Examples of chemical investigations include chemical weathering, and recrystallization (by testing the solubility of different materials) or
    melt generation (by examining how water lowers the melting temperature of most solids).]
                                                                                                                                                 304


HS-ESS2-6.
   Develop a quantitative model to describe the cycling of carbon among the hydrosphere, atmosphere, geosphere, and biosphere.
   [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on modeling biogeochemical cycles that include the cycling of carbon through the ocean, atmosphere,
   soil, permafrost, and biosphere (including humans), providing the foundation for living organisms.]
HS-ESS2-7.
   Construct an argument based on evidence about the simultaneous coevolution of Earth's systems and life on Earth. [Clarification
   Statement: Emphasis is on the dynamic causes, effects, and feedbacks between the biosphere and Earth’s other systems, whereby
   geoscience factors control the evolution of life, which in turn continuously alters Earth’s surface. Examples include how photosynthetic life
   altered the atmosphere through the production of oxygen, which in turn increased weathering rates and allowed for the evolution of animal
   life; how microbial life on land increased the formation of soil, which in turn allowed for the evolution of land plants; or how the evolution of
   corals created reefs that altered patterns of erosion and deposition along coastlines and provided habitats for the evolution of new life
   forms.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of how the biosphere
   interacts with all of Earth’s other systems.]

Students who demonstrate understanding can: Plan and conduct an investigation of the properties of water and its effects on Earth materials
and surface processes.
Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on mechanical and chemical investigations with water and a variety of solid materials to provide evidence
for the connections between the hydrologic cycle and system interactions commonly known as the rock cycle. Examples of mechanical
investigations include stream transportation and deposition using a stream table, beach erosion and deposition patterns in relation to substrate
type and size, erosion using variations in soil moisture content, and frost wedging by the expansion of water as it freezes. Examples of chemical
investigations include chemical weathering, and recrystallization (by testing the solubility of different materials) or melt generation (by
examining how water lowers the melting temperature of most solids).

    Create a computational simulation to illustrate the relationships among the management of natural resources, the sustainability of
    human populations, and biodiversity. [Clarification Statement: Examples of factors that affect the management of natural resources include
    costs of resource extraction and waste management, per-capita consumption, and the development of new technologies. Examples of
    factors that affect human sustainability include agricultural efficiency, levels of conservation, and urban planning.] [Assessment Boundary:
    Assessment for computational simulations is limited to using provided multi-parameter programs or constructing simplified spreadsheet
    calculations.]

   Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.* [Clarification Statement:
   Examples of data on the impacts of human activities could include the quantities and types of pollutants released, changes to biomass and
   species diversity, or areal changes in land surface use (such as for urban development, agriculture and livestock, or surface mining).
   Examples for limiting future impacts could range from local efforts (such as reducing, reusing, and recycling resources) to large-scale
   geoengineering design solutions (such as altering global temperatures by making large changes to the atmosphere or ocean).]
HS-ESS3-6.
   Use a computational representation to illustrate the relationships among Earth systems and how those relationships are being modified
   due to human activity. [Clarification Statement: Examples of Earth systems to be considered are the hydrosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere,
   geosphere, and/or biosphere. An example of the far-reaching impacts from a human activity is how an increase in atmospheric carbon
   dioxide results in an increase in photosynthetic biomass on land and an increase in ocean acidification, with resulting impacts on sea
   organism health and marine populations.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include running computational representations but is
   limited to using the published results of scientific computational models.]

Students who demonstrate understanding can: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources,
occurrence of natural hazards, and changes in climate have influenced human activity.
Clarification Statement: Examples of key natural resources include access to fresh water (such as rivers, lakes and groundwater), regions of
fertile soils such as river deltas, and high concentrations of minerals, wildlife, fish, trees, and fossil fuels. Examples of natural hazards can be from
interior processes (such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes), surface processes (such as tsunamis, mass wasting, and soil erosion), and severe
weather (such as hurricanes, floods, storm surge, lightning strike fires, and droughts). Examples of the results of changes in climate that can
affect populations or drive mass migrations include changes to sea level, regional patterns of temperature and precipitation, changes in stream
or ocean water temperatures and/or chemistry, and the types of food that can be raised, hunted, fished, harvested, or gathered.

HS-ESS3-6
Students who demonstrate understanding can: Use a computational representation to illustrate the relationships among Earth systems and
how those relationships are being modified due to human activity.
Clarification Statement: Examples of Earth systems to be considered are the hydrosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, and/or
biosphere. An example of the far-reaching impacts from a human activity is how an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide results in an increase
in photosynthetic biomass on land and an increase in ocean acidification, with resulting impacts on sea organism health and marine populations.
Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include running computational representations but is limited to using the published results of
scientific computational models.
