Purpose of Science
“Science is facts; just as houses are made of stone, so is science made of facts; but a pile of stones is not
a house, and a collection of facts is not necessarily science.”
 --Jules Henri Poincaré (1854-1912) French mathematician
High expectations in education are essential for the U.S. to continue as a world leader in the 21st
century. In order to be successful in postsecondary education, the workforce, and in life, students need
a rigorous, age-appropriate set of standards that include finding and gathering information, critical
thinking, and reasoning skills to evaluate information, and use information in social and cultural
contexts. Students must learn to comprehend and process information, analyze and draw conclusions,
and apply the results to everyday life.
A quality science education embodies 21st century skills and postsecondary and workforce readiness by
teaching students critical skills and thought processes to meet the challenges of today’s world.
Scientifically literate graduates will help to ensure Colorado’s economic vitality by encouraging the
development of research and technology, managing and preserving our environmental treasures, and
caring for the health and well-being of our citizens.
Science is both a body of knowledge that represents the current understanding of natural systems, and
the process whereby that body of knowledge has been established and is continually extended, refined,
and revised. Because science is both the knowledge of the natural world and the processes that have
established this knowledge, science education must address both of these aspects.
At a time when pseudo-scientific ideas and outright fraud are becoming more common place,
developing the skepticism and critical thinking skills of science gives students vital skills needed to make
informed decisions about their health, the environment, and other scientific issues facing society. A
major aspect of science is the continual interpretation of evidence. All scientific ideas constantly are
being challenged by new evidence and are evolving to fit the new evidence. Students must understand
the collaborative social processes that guide these changes so they can reason through and think
critically about popular scientific information, and draw valid conclusions based on evidence, which
often is limited. Imbedded in the cognitive process, students learn and apply the social and cultural skills
expected of all citizens in school and in the workplace. For example, during class activities, laboratory
exercises, and projects, students learn and practice self-discipline, collaboration, and working in groups.
The Colorado Academic Standards in science represent what all Colorado students should know and be
able to do in science as a result of their preschool through twelfth-grade science education. Specific
expectations are given for students who complete each grade from preschool through eighth grade and
for high school. These standards outline the essential level of science content knowledge and the
application of the skills needed by all Colorado citizens to participate productively in our increasingly
global, information-driven society.

Standards in Science
Standards are the topical organization of an academic content area. The three standards of science,
including the disciplinary core ideas, are:
1. Physical Science
Students know and understand common properties, forms, and changes in matter and energy.
        PS1 Matter and Its Interactions
        PS2 Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions
        PS3 Energy
        PS4 Waves and Their Applications in Technologies for Information Transfer
2. Life Science
Students know and understand the characteristics and structure of living things, the processes of life,
and how living things interact with each other and their environment.
        LS1 From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes
        LS2 Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics
        LS3 Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits
        LS4 Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity
3. Earth and Space Science
Students know and understand the processes and interactions of Earth's systems and the structure and
dynamics of Earth and other objects in space.
        ESS1 Earth’s Place in the Universe
        ESS2 Earth’s Systems
        ESS3 Earth ad Human Activity
Science and Engineering Practices
1. Asking questions (for science) and defining problems (for engineering)
2. Developing and using models
3. Planning and carrying out investigations
4. Analyzing and interpreting data
5. Using mathematics and computational thinking
6. Constructing explanations (for science) and designing solutions (for engineering)
7. Engaging in argument from evidence
8. Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information
2020 Colorado Academic Standards                                                                    Page 7


Cross Cutting Concepts
1. Patterns. Observed patterns of forms and events guide organization and classification, and they
    prompt questions about relationships and the factors that influence them.
2. Cause and effect: Mechanism and explanation. Events have causes, sometimes simple, sometimes
    multifaceted. A major activity of science is investigating and explaining causal relationships and the
    mechanisms by which they are mediated. Such mechanisms can then be tested across given
    contexts and used to predict and explain events in new contexts.
3. Scale, proportion, and quantity. In considering phenomena, it is critical to recognize what is relevant
    at different measures of size, time, and energy and to recognize how changes in scale, proportion,
    or quantity affect a system’s structure or performance.
4. Systems and system models. Defining the system under study—specifying its boundaries and making
    explicit a model of that system—provides tools for understanding and testing ideas that are
    applicable throughout science and engineering.
5. Energy and matter: Flows, cycles, and conservation. Tracking fluxes of energy and matter into, out
    of, and within systems helps one understand the systems’ possibilities and limitations.
6. Structure and function. The way in which an object or living thing is shaped and its substructure
    determine many of its properties and functions.
7. Stability and change. For natural and built systems alike, conditions of stability and determinants of
    rates of change or evolution of a system are critical elements of study.

Academic Context and Connections in Science:
Colorado Essential Skills and Science and Engineering Practices: These statements describe how the
        learning of the content and skills described by the GLE and EOs connects to and supports the
        development of the Colorado Essential Skills named in the parentheses. The science and
        engineering practices are things that scientists employ as they investigate and build models and
        theories about the world. These terms are used to emphasize that engaging in scientific
        investigation requires not only skill but also knowledge that is specific to each practice.
Elaboration on the GLE: This section provides greater context for the GLE through a description of the
        understanding about the core ideas that should be developed by students.
Cross Cutting Concepts: The crosscutting concepts have application across all domains of science. As
        such, they provide one way of linking across the domains through core ideas.

2. PS2:A Forces and Motion: Each force acts on one particular object and has
    both strength and a direction. An object at rest typically has multiple forces
    acting on it, but they add to give zero net force on the object. Forces that
    do not sum to zero can cause changes in the object’s speed or direction of
    motion. (Boundary: Qualitative and conceptual, but not quantitative
    addition of forces is used at this level). The patterns of an object’s motion in
    various situations can be observed and measured; when that past motion
    exhibits a regular pattern, future motion can be predicted from it.

2. Patterns: Patterns can be used to identify cause and effect relationships.
3. Connections to Engineering, Technology, and Applications of Science
4. Influence of Science, Engineering, and Technology on Society and the
   Natural World: The use of technologies and any limitations on their use are
   driven by individual or societal needs, desires, and values; by the findings of
   scientific research; and by differences in such factors as climate, natural
   resources, and economic conditions. Thus technology use varies from
   region to region and over time.

   and Consistency in Natural Systems. Science assumes that objects and
   events in natural systems occur in consistent patterns that are

   describe the consequences of actions but does not necessarily prescribe the
   decisions that society takes.

Cross Cutting Concepts:
1. Cause and Effect: Relationships can be classified as causal or correlational,
   and correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Cause and effect
   relationships may be used to predict phenomena in natural or designed
   systems.
2. Influence of Science, Engineering, and Technology on Society and the
   Natural World: All human activity draws on natural resources and has both
   short and long-term consequences, positive as well as negative, for the
   health of people and the natural environment. The uses of technologies and
   any limitations on their use are driven by individual or societal needs,
   desires, and values; by the findings of scientific research; and by differences
   in such factors as climate, natural resources, and economic conditions. Thus
   technology use varies from region to region and over time.
3. Science Addresses Questions About the Natural and Material World:
   Scientific knowledge can describe the consequences of actions but does not
   necessarily prescribe the decisions that society takes.

2. LS1:C Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms: The process of      system.
   photosynthesis converts light energy to stored chemical energy by
   converting carbon dioxide plus water into sugars plus released oxygen. The
   sugar molecules thus formed contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen: Their
   hydrocarbon backbones are used to make amino acids and other carbon-
   based molecules that can be assembled into larger molecules (such as
   proteins or DNA), used for example to form new cells. As matter and energy
   flow through different organizational levels of living systems, chemical
   elements are recombined in different ways to form different products. As a
   result of these chemical reactions, energy is transferred from one system of
   interacting molecules to another and release energy to the surrounding
   environment and to maintain body temperature. Cellular respiration is a
   chemical process whereby the bonds of food molecules and oxygen
   molecules are broken and new compounds are formed that can transport
   energy to muscles.

   resources that individuals need in order to survive and reproduce, and (4)
   the ensuing proliferation of those organisms that are better able to survive
   and reproduce in that environment. Natural selection leads to adaptation,
   that is, to a population dominated by organisms that are anatomically,
   behaviorally, and physiologically well suited to survive and reproduce in a
   specific environment. That is, the differential survival and reproduction of
   organisms in a population that have an advantageous heritable trait leads
   to an increase in the proportion of individuals in future generations that
   have the trait and to a decrease in the proportion of individuals that do not.
   Adaptation also means that the distribution of traits in a population can
   change when conditions change. Changes in the physical environment,
   whether naturally occurring or human induced, have thus contributed to
   the expansion of some species, the emergence of new distinct species as
   populations diverge under different conditions, and the decline–and
   sometimes the extinction–of some species. Species become extinct because
   they can no longer survive and reproduce in their altered environment. If
   members cannot adjust to change that is too fast or drastic, the opportunity
   for the species’ evolution is lost.

2. ESS1:A The Universe and Its Stars: The star called the sun is changing and
   will burn out over a life span of approximately 10 billion years. The sun is
   just one of more than 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, and the
   Milky Way is just one of hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe. The
   study of stars’ light spectra and brightness is used to identify compositional
   elements of stars, their movements, and their distances from Earth. The Big
   Bang theory is supported by observations of distant galaxies receding from
   our own, of the measured composition of stars and non-stellar gases, and
   of the maps of spectra of the primordial radiation (cosmic microwave
   background) that still fills the universe. Other than the hydrogen and helium
   formed at the time of the Big Bang, nuclear fusion within stars produces all
   atomic nuclei lighter than and including iron, and the process releases
   electromagnetic energy. Heavier elements are produced when certain
   massive stars achieve a supernova stage and explode.
