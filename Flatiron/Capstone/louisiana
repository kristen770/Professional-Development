                                                                                       SHIFTS IN SCIENCE
The following are the key shifts called for by the Louisiana Student Standards for Science.
1. Apply content knowledge                        Content knowledge is critical and evident in the
                                                  standards in the Disciplinary Core Ideas, the key
                                                  ideas in science that have broad importance
                                                  within or across multiple science or engineering
                                                  disciplines. However, simply having content
                                                  knowledge is not enough. Students must
                                                  investigate and apply content knowledge to
                                                  scientific phenomenon.
2. Investigate, evaluate, and reason              Scientists do more than learn about science; they
   scientifically                                   do science. Science instruction must integrate
                                                  the practices, or behaviors, of scientists and
                                                  engineers as they investigate real-world
                                                  phenomenon and design solutions to problems.
3. Connect ideas across disciplines               For students to develop a coherent and
                                                  scientifically-based view of the world, they must
                                                  make connections across the domains of science
                                                  (life science, physical science, earth and space
                                                  science, environmental science, and
                                                  engineering, technology, and applications of
                                                  science). The crosscutting concepts have
                                                  applications across all domains.

                                   equal to 1,000,000, a digit in one place represents ten times what it
                                   represents in the place to its right. For example, (1) recognize that
                                   700 ÷ 70 = 10; (2) in the number 7,246, the 2 represents 200, but in the
                                   number 7,426 the 2 represents 20, recognizing that 200 is ten times as
                                   large as 20, by applying concepts of place value and division.

                                   5.NBT.A.1 Recognize that in a multi-digit number, a digit in one place
                                   represents 10 times as much as it represents in the place to its right
                                   and 1/10 of what it represents in the place to its left.

                                   Use whole-number exponents to denote powers of 10. For example,
                                   100 = 1, 101 =10 ... and 2.1 x 102 = 210.

                                 numbers, fractions, and decimals, and interpret numerical
                                 expressions without evaluating them. For example, express the
                                 calculation “add 8 and 7, then multiply by 2” as 2 × (8 + 7).
                                 Recognize that 3 x (18,932 + 9.21) is three times as large as 18,932 +
                                 9.21, without having to calculate the indicated sum or product.
                                 5.NBT.A.1 Recognize that in a multi-digit number, a digit in one place
                                 represents 10 times as much as it represents in the place to its right
                                 and 1/10 of what it represents in the place to its left.
                                 5.NBT.A.2 Explain and apply patterns in the number of zeros of the
                                 product when multiplying a number by powers of 10. Explain and

                                 quotient, when a decimal is multiplied or divided by a power of 10.
                                 Use whole-number exponents to denote powers of 10. For example,
                                 100 = 1, 101 = 10 ... and 2.1 x 102 = 210.
                                 5.NBT.A.3 Read, write, and compare decimals to thousandths.
                                     a. Read and write decimals to thousandths using base-ten
                                          numerals, number names, and expanded form, e.g.,

                                            (1/1000).
                                     b. Compare two decimals to thousandths based on meanings
                                          of the digits in each place, using >, =, and < symbols to
                                          record the results of comparisons.
                                 5.NBT.A.4 Use place value understanding to round decimals to any
                                 place.
                                 6.RP.A.1 Understand the concept of a ratio and use ratio language
                                 to describe a ratio relationship between two quantities. For example,
                                 “The ratio of wings to beaks in the bird house at the zoo was 2:1,
                                 because for every 2 wings there was 1 beak.” “For every vote
                                                                                                        B-34


                                                                                                        6
                                                                        CONNECTIONS TO ELA & MATH
                                 candidate A received, candidate C received nearly three votes.”
                                 6.RP.A.2 Understand the concept of a unit rate         associated with a
                                 ratio     with        , and use rate language in the context of a ratio
                                 relationship. For example, “This recipe has a ratio of 3 cups of flour to
                                 4 cups of sugar, so there is 3/4 cup of flour for each cup of sugar.”
                                 “We paid $75 for 15 hamburgers, which is a rate of $5 per
                                 hamburger.”
                                 6.RP.A.3 Use ratio and rate reasoning to solve real-world and
                                 mathematical problems, e.g., by reasoning about tables of
                                 equivalent ratios, tape diagrams, double number line diagrams, or
                                 equations.
                                     a. Make tables of equivalent ratios relating quantities with
                                         whole-number measurements, find missing values in the
                                         tables, and plot the pairs of values on the coordinate plane.
                                         Use tables to compare ratios.
                                     b. Solve unit rate problems including those involving unit pricing
                                         and constant speed. For example, if it took 7 hours to mow 4
                                         lawns, then at that rate, how many lawns could be mowed in
                                         35 hours? At what unit rate were lawns being mowed?
                                     c. Find a percent of a quantity as a rate per 100 (e.g., 30% of a
                                         quantity means 30/100 times the quantity); solve problems
                                         involving finding the whole, given a part and the percent.
                                     d. Use ratio reasoning to convert measurement units;
                                         manipulate and transform units appropriately when
                                         multiplying or dividing quantities.

                                 represent the problem. For example, interpret 3/4 as the result of
                                 dividing 3 by 4, noting that 3/4 multiplied by 4 equals 3, and that

                               to describe a ratio relationship between two quantities. For example,
                               “The ratio of wings to beaks in the bird house at the zoo was 2:1,
                               because for every 2 wings there was 1 beak.” “For every vote

                             4 cups of sugar, so there is 3/4 cup of flour for each cup of sugar.”
                             “We paid $75 for 15 hamburgers, which is a rate of $5 per
                             hamburger.”
                             6.RP.A.3 Use ratio and rate reasoning to solve real-world and
                             mathematical problems, e.g., by reasoning about tables of
                             equivalent ratios, tape diagrams, double number line diagrams, or
                             equations.
                                 a. Make tables of equivalent ratios relating quantities with
                                     whole-number measurements, find missing values in the
                                     tables, and plot the pairs of values on the coordinate plane.
                                     Use tables to compare ratios.
                                 b. Solve unit rate problems including those involving unit pricing
                                     and constant speed. For example, if it took 7 hours to mow 4
                                     lawns, then at that rate, how many lawns could be mowed in
                                     35 hours? At what unit rate were lawns being mowed?
                                 c. Find a percent of a quantity as a rate per 100 (e.g., 30% of a
                                     quantity means 30/100 times the quantity); solve problems
                                     involving finding the whole, given a part and the percent.
                                 d. Use ratio reasoning to convert measurement units;
                                     manipulate and transform units appropriately when
                                     multiplying or dividing quantities.
                             6.EE.B.5 Understand solving an equation or inequality as a process of
                             answering a question: which values from a specified set, if any, make
                             the equation or inequality true? Use substitution to determine
                             whether a given number in a specified set makes an equation or
                             inequality true.
                             6.EE.B.6. Use variables to represent numbers and write expressions
                             when solving a real-world or mathematical problem; understand that
                             a variable can represent an unknown number, or, depending on the
                             purpose at hand, any number in a specified set.
                             6.EE.B.7 Solve real-world and mathematical problems by writing and
                             solving equations and inequalities of the form x + p = q and px = q for

                                          and constant speed. For example, if it took 7 hours to mow 4
                                          lawns, then at that rate, how many lawns could be mowed in
                                          35 hours? At what unit rate were lawns being mowed?
                                      c. Find a percent of a quantity as a rate per 100 (e.g., 30% of a
                                          quantity means 30/100 times the quantity); solve problems
                                          involving finding the whole, given a part and the percent.
                                      d. Use ratio reasoning to convert measurement units;
                                          manipulate and transform units appropriately when
                                          multiplying or dividing quantities.

                                 including ratios of lengths, areas, and other quantities measured in
                                 like or different units. For example, if a person walks ½ mile in each ¼
                                                                                                            B-51

                                 hour, equivalently 2 miles per hour.
                                 7.RP.A.2 Recognize and represent proportional relationships between
                                 quantities.
                                     a. Decide whether two quantities are in a proportional
                                          relationship, e.g., by testing for equivalent ratios in a table or
                                          graphing on a coordinate plane and observing whether the
                                          graph is a straight line through the origin.
                                     b. Identify the constant of proportionality (unit rate) in tables,
                                          graphs, equations, diagrams, and verbal descriptions of
                                          proportional relationships.
                                     c. Represent proportional relationships by equations. For
                                          example, if total cost t is proportional to the number n of
                                          items purchased at a constant price p, the relationship
                                          between the total cost and the number of items can be
                                          expressed as t = pn.
                                     d. Explain what a point (x, y) on the graph of a proportional
                                          relationship means in terms of the situation, with special
                                          attention to the points (0, 0) and (1, r) where r is the unit rate.

                                      a. Describe situations in which opposite quantities combine to
                                           make 0. For example, a hydrogen atom has 0 charge
                                           because its two constituents are oppositely charged.
                                      b. Understand p + q as the number located a distance |q|

                                           additive inverse, p – q = p + (–q). Show that the distance

                                 mathematical problems, e.g., by reasoning about tables of
                                 equivalent ratios, tape diagrams, double number line diagrams, or
                                 equations.
                                     a. Make tables of equivalent ratios relating quantities with
                                          whole-number measurements, find missing values in the
                                          tables, and plot the pairs of values on the coordinate plane.
                                          Use tables to compare ratios.
                                     b. Solve unit rate problems including those involving unit pricing
                                          and constant speed. For example, if it took 7 hours to mow 4

                                     c. Find a percent of a quantity as a rate per 100 (e.g., 30% of a
                                          quantity means 30/100 times the quantity); solve problems
                                          involving finding the whole, given a part and the percent.
                                     d. Use ratio reasoning to convert measurement units;

                                      a. Decide whether two quantities are in a proportional
                                          relationship, e.g., by testing for equivalent ratios in a table or
                                          graphing on a coordinate plane and observing whether the
                                          graph is a straight line through the origin.
                                      b. Identify the constant of proportionality (unit rate) in tables,

                                          proportional relationships.
                                      c. Represent proportional relationships by equations. For
                                          example, if total cost t is proportional to the number n of
                                          items purchased at a constant price p, the relationship
                                          between the total cost and the number of items can be
                                          expressed as t = pn.
                                      d. Explain what a point (x, y) on the graph of a proportional
                                          relationship means in terms of the situation, with special
                                          attention to the points (0, 0) and (1, r) where r is the unit rate.

Louisiana Student Standards for Science
The Louisiana Student Standards for Science were created by over eighty content experts and educators with input from parents and
teachers from across the state. Educators envisioned what students should know and be able to do to compete in our communities
and created standards that would allow students to do so. The Louisiana Student Standards for Science provide appropriate content
for all grades or courses, maintain high expectations and create a logical connection of content across and within grades.
The Louisiana Student Standards for Science represent the knowledge and skills needed for students to successfully transition to
postsecondary educations and the workplace. The standards call for students to:
•    Apply content knowledge
•    Investigate, evaluate, and reason scientifically
•    Connect ideas across disciplines
The Louisiana Student Standards do not dictate curriculum or teaching methods. Decisions about how to teach these expectations
are left to local districts, schools, and teachers.
Structure and Components of the Standards
The Louisiana Student Standards for Science are arranged by grade levels for kindergarten through grade 8 and content areas for
high school. The standards include:
•    Performance expectations define what students should be able to do by the end of the year.
•    Science and engineering practices are the practices that scientists and engineers use when investigating real world phenomena
     and designing solutions to problems. There are eight science and engineering practices that apply to all grade levels and
     content areas.
      1.  Asking questions (science) and defining problems (engineering)
      2.  Developing and using models
      3.  Planning and carrying out investigations
      4.  Analyzing and interpreting data
      5.  Using mathematical and computational thinking
      6.  Constructing explanations (science) and designing solutions (engineering)
      7.  Engaging in argument with evidence
      8.  Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information
•    Disciplinary Core Ideas describe the most essential ideas (content) in the major science disciplines that students will learn.
     Disciplinary Core Ideas are grouped into five science domains.
      1.  Physical Science (PS)
      2.  Life Science (LS)
      3.  Earth and Space Science (ESS)
      4.  Environmental Science (EVS)
      5.  Engineering, Technology, and Applications of Science (ETS)
•    Crosscutting Concepts are common themes that have application across all disciplines of science and allow students to
     connect learning within and across grade levels or content areas. The seven crosscutting concepts apply to all grade levels and
     content areas.
      1.  Patterns
      2.  Cause and effect
      3.  Scale, proportion, and quantity
      4.  Systems and System Models
      5.  Energy and matter
      6.  Structure and function
      7.  Stability and change
•    Clarification statements provide examples or additional explanation to the performance expectation.
                                                                                                                                    1
