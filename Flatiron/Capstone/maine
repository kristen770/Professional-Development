Chapter 132 – Learning Results: Parameters for Essential Instruction and State Accountability
SUMMARY: The Maine Department of Education Regulation 132 - The Maine Learning Results: Parameters for Essential Instruction
and State Accountability establishes parameters for essential teaching and learning in grades Pre-Kindergarten through Diploma across
eight content areas and supports the goals outlined in the Guiding Principles. The Maine Learning Results: Parameters for Essential
Instruction and State Accountability will inform the blueprint for item development of the large-scale State assessments aligned to the
federal accountability standards found in Maine Department of Education Regulation 131 – The Federal, State, and Local Accountability
Standards. High school, middle school, and elementary school programming in Maine’s publicly supported schools must be aligned to
the knowledge and skills described in the Maine Learning Results: Parameters for Essential Instruction and State Accountability.
The Maine Department of Education Regulation 132 - The Maine Learning Results: Parameters for Essential Instruction and State
Accountability augments and expands upon the content standards for federal accountability (Maine Department of Education
Regulation 131: The Maine Federal, State, and Local Accountability Standards) by describing details for essential teaching and learning
for eight content areas. These learning goals identify the knowledge and skills required for college, career and citizenship in the 21st
century.

                                                     CAREER AND EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT
Career and education development helps all students gain the knowledge, skills, and behaviors to interact with others, set goals, and
make decisions related to career, college, and citizenship. Success in the twenty-first century differs significantly from the twentieth
century model. Lifelong employment with a single employer has virtually vanished. Success today is increasingly dependent on a
sophisticated knowledge base, the ability to enhance that base, to collaborate, to self-direct, and to adapt to change. Individuals will
need to adapt their goals and decisions over their lifetimes in relation to school and workplace requirements and personal
responsibilities. As part of career and education development, students must see education as a continuous lifelong process that will
prepare them for and make them adaptable in a complex, information-rich, and fast-changing world.
        Embed Career and Education Development Instruction - The knowledge, skills, and behaviors outlined in Career and
        Education Development Standards are essential for all students. It is important that the knowledge, skills, and behaviors of
        career and education development be connected to the context of schools, career, and community. Although stand- alone
        courses in career and education development may serve to help students focus on career, college, and citizenship goal, all
        content areas need to embed career and educations standards to enable students to make the connection between content
        areas schoolwork, and career, college, and citizenship goals. School administrative units should determine the most
        appropriate content areas and school settings in which to embed these standards.

                                                                ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS
The English language arts form the foundation for effective communication. The ability to construct meaning through reading, writing,
listening, speaking, viewing, and the process of inquiring as well as the ability to present ideas through writing, speaking, and visual
media are the bases of English language arts. These skills, essential to the health of our democracy and the quality of our culture, have
become ever more important with the modern explosion of modern communication media. Effective communication is critical regardless
of the devices used or the distances over which we are communicating.
The study of language helps students to control their lives and become more effective thinkers through communication, reflection, and
understanding. To develop good thinking strategies, students must become engaged as active learners. To help them improve,
students need to practice English language arts skills and receive frequent feedback across all areas of study. Parents, teachers, and
other adults must encourage the interest in language that students bring with them when they first enter school. Collectively, the English
language arts constitute both a discipline in its own right, like mathematics or science, and a means of communicating about all other
disciplines. Without a command of these English language arts, it is difficult to think about, understand, or explain other disciplines.
Literacy Skills Across the Content Areas - The English Language Arts Standards describe the knowledge and skills all students
need to be successful. These skills are important for career, college, and citizenship. These skills are also essential as students
progress through their Pre-K-Diploma experience for accessing and sharing knowledge across content areas. Schools and teachers
must take particular care to support and hold students accountable for the application of the performance indicators related to research,
analysis of media, informational/position-taking writing, informational reading, listening, and speaking, where applicable, across all
content areas. Maine’s business community and higher education institutions have formally and informally underscored this need for
effective communication and cross-content literacy.

        Research – Research is an essential skill for success in the workplace, in college, and in life. All students should be able to
        locate information to support decisions and answer questions. Schools must ensure that the skills and knowledge of research
        are applied in all content areas.
        Reading and Writing Processes - The English Language Arts Standards attempt to present the processes of reading, writing
        and the varied genres related to the two in a clear, concise format. This approach may create the misperception that these
        aspects of English language arts are linear and entirely discrete whereas they are often dynamic, iterative processes and
        sometimes overlapping constructs. Schools and teachers must recognize and accommodate this complexity in their student
        instruction.
        Text Complexity - The use of reading standards is incomplete without a consideration of text complexity. The standards explain
        the knowledge and skills of reading. Text complexity provides a common understanding of the difficulty of the reading material to
        which the standards are applied. A grade appropriate span of text complexity can be determined in various ways including the
        use of reading lists, teacher judgment, and other standardized measures. An understanding of a student’s reading ability, as
        defined by the text complexity that the student can successfully comprehend, is an important diagnostic tool for teachers as they
        work to advance the student’s skills and ability to use those skills with increasingly complex texts. There are a number of
        variables that contribute to the complexity of any text including word difficulty, sentence complexity, familiarity of content,
        required background knowledge, organization of the text, unity of the writing, quality and rigor of the writing, and text length. The
        goal of the Maine Learning Results is to ensure that all students can read and comprehend texts that reflect the text complexity
        required for career, college, and citizenship.
        Grade Appropriate Span of Text Complexity - The phrase grade appropriate span of text complexity refers to the range of
        complexity appropriate for the identified grade or grade span.

                                                 HEALTH EDUCATION AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION
The Health Education and Physical Education Standards and performance indicators represent the essential knowledge and skills
students need to be healthy individuals. Every day, students make decisions affecting their health and well-being: what foods to eat;
what company to keep; what risks to take; and what to do for physical activity. These decisions often lead to habits that stay with them
throughout life. The Health Education and Physical Education Standards will guide instruction that will help students make better
decisions about their health. Through achievement of the Health Education and Physical Education Standards, students learn that their
decisions can affect their health and set a pattern for their lives. Students also learn to protect their health by acquiring good
information, by seeking good advice and friendships, and by taking responsibility for their own wellness which contributes to a healthy,
active, balanced approach to life.
Health education gives students the knowledge and skills to thrive physically, mentally, emotionally, and socially. It contributes to
students’ ability to successfully practice behaviors that protect and promote health, and avoid and reduce health risks. Health
education helps students to determine personal values and group norms that support healthy behaviors. Through comprehensive
health education, students learn basic health concepts and influences on health. They develop the skills required to adopt, practice, and
maintain health-enhancing and safe behaviors. These skills include: analyzing the reliability and validity of media and health resources;
communicating effectively using refusal and conflict management skills; setting goals; and making healthy decisions. Health education
helps students to be better consumers of information, manage stress, and make healthy decisions in the face of conflicting messages. It
assists them in living healthier lives.
Physical education provides students with the skills and knowledge needed to support participation in a wide variety of physical
activities that contribute to an active lifestyle. Physical education provides building blocks for skill development, skill analysis, physical
fitness, stress reduction, decision-making, and positive social skills. Students learn to assess and set goals, evaluate their own physical
fitness, and use the knowledge to maintain or improve their current fitness level. Students who participate in physical education on a
regular basis learn the benefits of physical activity and its contribution to a healthy lifestyle.

Education must equip all students with mathematical skills and ways of thinking that provide them with the flexibility, adaptability, and
creativity to function as productive citizens in the changing society of the 21st century. Mathematical understanding must extend beyond
the skills of calculation and manipulation of numbers and symbols to the use of mathematics to investigate, predict, analyze, interpret,
create, and evaluate.
Deep mathematical understanding develops over time. While performance indicators describe the knowledge and skills expected at a
given grade level, these concepts and skills may be introduced in previous years. They will also be used in later years as the
foundations for more advanced topics or in new problem situations.
The use of “understand” in this document is intended to communicate the desired depth and breadth of mathematics programs for
Maine students. To understand a procedure or concept means to be able to:
    • communicate its meaning, its use, the results of its application, and its implications for a given context,
    • reason about it by making conjectures and justifying conclusions,
    • represent it in a variety of ways,
    • connect it to other ideas in and outside of mathematics, and
    • know when and how to apply it to solve problems in mathematics and in other contexts.
Central to mathematical understanding is learning through problems that arise in mathematics and applied contexts. To this end,
students learn to identify problems, formulate approaches, carry out these approaches, and communicate and justify solutions.
Mathematical reasoning pervades all areas of mathematics. Mathematical reasoning is manifested through classification, comparison,
deduction, induction, generalization, justification, verification, and spatial visualization.
As growing mathematicians, students need to do mathematics and see themselves as capable of developing their own understanding
of mathematical concepts, properties, and procedures. Mathematics classrooms should provide practical experiences using


05 -071   Chapter 132 - Learning Results : Parameters for Essential Instruction and State Accountability                     Page 60 of 225
mathematics in everyday applications and in other content areas, as well as explorations solely within mathematics. Discussing
mathematics is an important component of developing mathematical understanding. Technology should be used as an aid to
understanding mathematical ideas. Classrooms that reflect these beliefs prepare students to be confident and effective mathematical
thinkers.
As lifelong learners students will research mathematics concepts and methods. They must learn about sources of mathematics
information, how to read and comprehend mathematics, how to employ the mathematical ideas they learn, and how to communicate
what they learn.
The State of Maine should expect its students to enjoy, appreciate, and use mathematics. Students who are challenged to master the
Mathematics Standards and are supported in reaching them will be better prepared for a future in which mathematics will be
increasingly important in all areas of endeavor.

A. NUMBER: Students use numbers in everyday and mathematical contexts to quantify or describe phenomena, develop
    concepts of operations with different types of numbers, use the structure and properties of numbers with operations to
    solve problems, and perform mathematical computations. Students develop number sense related to magnitude,
    estimation, and the effects of mathematical operations on different types of numbers. It is expected that students use
    numbers flexibly, using forms of numbers that best match a situation. Students compute efficiently and accurately.
    Estimation should always be used when computing with numbers or solving problems.

Real Number
9-Diploma Performance Indicators & Descriptors
1 Students know how to represent and use real numbers.
    a.  Use the concept of nth root.
    b.  Estimate the value(s) of roots and use technology to approximate them.
    c.  Compute using laws of exponents.
    d.  Multiply and divide numbers expressed in scientific notation.
    e.  Understand that some quadratic equations do not have real solutions and that there exist other number systems to allow for
        solutions to these equations.
B. DATA: Students make measurements and collect, display, evaluate, analyze, and compute with data to describe or model
    phenomena and to make decisions based on data. Students compute statistics to summarize data sets and use concepts
    of probability to make predictions and describe the uncertainty inherent in data collection and measurement. It is
    expected that when working with measurements students:
        • understand that most measurements are approximations and that taking repeated measurements reveals this
            variability;
        • understand that a number without a unit is not a measurement, and that an appropriate unit must always be
            attached to a number to provide a measurement;
        • understand that the precision and accuracy of a measurement depends on selecting the appropriate tools and units;
            and
        • use estimation comparing measures to benchmarks appropriate to the type of measure and units.
Measurement and Approximation
Pre-K-2 Performance Indicators & Descriptors
1 Students understand and use units of time, temperature, and money.
    a.  Apply and use sequences of hours in a day, days in a week, and months in a year.
    b.  Tell time to the hour and half hour.
    c.  Identify and give the value of different coins.
    d.  Find the total value of collections of coins up to $1.00.

    c.  Recognize positive and negative correlations based on data from a table or scatter plot.
    d.  Estimate the strength of correlation based upon a scatter plot.
3 Students understand and know how to describe distributions and find and use descriptive statistics for a set of data.
    a. Find and apply range, quartiles, mean absolute deviation, and standard deviation (using technology) of a set of data.
    b. Interpret, give examples of, and describe key differences among different types of distributions: uniform, normal, and skewed.
    c. For the sample mean of normal distributions, use the standard deviation for a group of observations to establish 90%, 95%, or
        99% confidence intervals.
4 Students understand that the purpose of random sampling is to reduce bias when creating a representative sample for a
    set of data.
    a. Describe and account for the difference between sample statistics and statistics describing the distribution of the entire
        population.
    b. Recognize that sample statistics produce estimates for the distribution of an entire population and recognize that larger sample
        sizes will produce more reliable estimates.
    c. Apply methods of creating random samples and recognize possible sources of bias in samples.

C. GEOMETRY: Students use measurement and observation to describe objects based on their sizes and shapes; model or
    construct two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects; solve problems involving geometric properties; compute areas
    and volumes based on object properties and dimensions; and perform transformations on geometric figures. When
    making or calculating measures students use estimation to check the reasonableness of results.

Science and engineering provide people with knowledge and tools to understand and address many of the challenges of a rapidly
changing world, thus enabling them to be creative and practical problem solvers (Maine Guiding Principle C). Science is a way of
knowing about the world that enables people to both engage in the construction of new knowledge and to use information to achieve
desired ends (NIH). Engineering enables people to systematically solve problems using scientific knowledge, to design and test
solutions and evaluate them using agreed-upon and measurable criteria.
Science and Engineering Literacy
In the last few decades, much has been written about the critical role of science literacy in an equitable and just society. For example,
the Board on Science Education within the National Academies of Science argue that
        “Science literacy is desirable not only for individuals, but also for the health and well-being of communities and society. More
        than just basic knowledge of science facts, contemporary definitions of science literacy have expanded to include
        understandings of scientific processes and practices, familiarity with how science and scientists work, a capacity to weigh and
        evaluate the products of science, and an ability to engage in civic decisions about the value of science.”
Here we recognize that, in addition to understanding and evaluating science knowledge and critiquing the development of that
knowledge, learners must also develop literacy related to science and engineering practices and design. In other words, they should
know about and be able to critique the processes by which engineers develop and test products in response to consumer, industrial,
and/or civic needs. The Maine Science and Engineering Standards provide a framework for supporting K-12 students’ development as
self-directed lifelong learners (Maine Guiding Principle B) who are able to apply knowledge from the domains of science and
engineering to set goals and make decisions.
Understanding Controversy in Science
Individuals have ready access to abundant information in our modern global society. Consequently, they will encounter myriad
arguments related to various scientific topics. Moreover, arguments will change over time, as new evidence becomes available and as
people draw on scientific evidence to formulate arguments in shifting social contexts. It is therefore imperative that individuals
understand that controversy within the scientific community is normal and has been historically productive. “True scientific controversy
involves competing scientific ideas that are evaluated according to the standards of science — i.e., fitting the evidence, generating
accurate expectations, offering satisfying explanations, inspiring research, etc...few theories fit our observations of the world perfectly.
There is usually some anomalous observation that doesn't seem to fit with our current understanding. Scientists assume that by
working at such anomalies, they'll either disentangle them to see how they fit with the current theory or contribute to a new theory”
("Even Theories Change." Understanding Science. University of California Museum of Paleontology. 23 July 2018
<http://www.understandingscience.org/article/alvarez_01>). One well documented example of productive controversy is the


05 -071    Chapter 132 - Learning Results : Parameters for Essential Instruction and State Accountability                         Page 94 of 225
development of modern theories that explain and predict phenomena in the physical world. Newton originally posited a theory of
mechanics that adequately explained phenomena as varied as projectile motion and planetary orbit. Centuries later, Einstein developed
the theory of special relativity to account for additional phenomena related to electricity and magnetism. The need to account for and
predict the effects of gravity spurred scientists to offer the theory of general relativity. Thus, “theory change is a community process of
feedback, experiment, observation, and communication. It usually involves interpreting existing data in new ways and incorporating
those views with new results” ("Even Theories Change." Understanding Science. University of California Museum of Paleontology. 23
July 2018 <http://www.understandingscience.org/article/alvarez_01>).
Becoming Critical and Engaged Consumers of Science and Engineering
As learners encounter diverse perspectives related to scientific issues, it is crucial that they become integrative and informed
thinkers (Maine Guiding Principle E) able to discern reliable and valid information. Such information is generated through accepted
scientific and engineering practices (e.g., analyzing and interpreting data, engaging in argument from evidence, etc.). Armed with
knowledge and these skills, learners will be able to function as responsible and involved citizens (Maine Guiding Principle D) who
utilize clear and effective communication strategies (Maine Guiding Principle A) to participate productively in decision making that
impacts the broader community.

                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on developing models of molecules that vary in complexity. Examples of
                        simple molecules could include ammonia and methanol. Examples of extended structures could include sodium
                        chloride or diamonds. Examples of molecular-level models could include drawings, three-dimensional ball and

                        resources and impact society.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on natural resources that undergo a chemical process to form synthetic
                        material. Examples of new materials could include new medicines, foods, and alternative fuels (alternative
                        plastics derived from potatoes and jet fuel made from trees). Other possible areas of study might include
                        plastics from organics, advanced composites and wood products under development at UMO.

                        that adding or removing thermal energy increases or decreases kinetic energy of the particles until a change of
                        state occurs. Examples of models could include drawings and diagrams. Examples of particles could include
                        molecules or inert atoms. Examples of pure substances could include water, carbon dioxide, and helium.

Performance             HS-PS1-1 Use the periodic table as a model to predict the relative properties of elements based on the
Expectations            patterns of electrons in the outermost energy level of atoms.
                        Further explanation: Examples of properties that could be predicted from patterns could include reactivity of
                        metals, types of bonds formed, numbers of bonds formed, and reactions with oxygen. Examples include the
                        properties and bonding of water and the rusting of metals as found in guardrails, ship parts, etc. Consider the
                        metal compounds found in fireworks.

                        chemical properties.
                        Further explanation: Examples of chemical reactions could include the reaction of sodium and chlorine, carbon
                        and oxygen, or carbon and hydrogen. Examples could include ocean salt formation, combustion (as found in
                        the burning of fuels in Maine homes, cars and the trucking industry) or the detection of carbon monoxide in a
                        home (complete vs incomplete combustion).

                       at the bulk scale to infer the strength of electrical forces between particles.
                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on understanding the strengths of forces between particles, not on naming
                       specific intermolecular forces (such as dipole-dipole). Examples of particles could include ions, atoms,
                       molecules, and networked materials (such as graphite). Examples of bulk properties of substances could
                       include the melting point and boiling point, vapor pressure, and surface tension. Examples could consider why
                       we salt roads in the winter, differences in melting points of water vs saltwater, the production of maple syrup or
                       the strength of Maine minerals.

                       HS-PS1-4 Develop a model to illustrate that the release or absorption of energy from a chemical
                       reaction system depends on the changes in total bond energy.
                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on the idea that a chemical reaction is a system that affects the energy
                       change. Examples of models could include molecular-level drawings and diagrams of reactions, graphs
                       showing the relative energies of reactants and products, and representations showing energy is conserved.

                       HS-PS1-5 Apply scientific principles and evidence to provide an explanation about the effects of
                       changing the temperature or concentration of the reacting particles on the rate at which a reaction
                       occurs.
                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on student reasoning that focuses on the number and energy of collisions
                       between molecules. Examples could include the varied rates of oxidation of metals in winter vs in summer or
                       the rate of dissolution of calcium shells in the ocean due to an increase in carbon dioxide an increase in
                       temperature from climate change.

                       produce increased amounts of products at equilibrium.
                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on the application of Le Chatelier’s Principle and on refining designs of
                       chemical reaction systems, including descriptions of the connection between changes made at the macroscopic
                       level and what happens at the molecular level. Examples of designs could include different ways to increase
                       product formation including adding reactants or removing products. Other examples to consider include the
                       Kraft paper making process, soap making or rock candy formation.

                        HS-PS1-7 Use mathematical representations to support the claim that atoms, and therefore mass, are
                        conserved during a chemical reaction.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on using mathematical ideas to communicate the proportional relationships
                        between masses of atoms in the reactants and the products, and the translation of these relationships to the
                        macroscopic scale using the mole as the conversion from the atomic to the macroscopic scale. Emphasis is on
                        assessing students’ use of mathematical thinking and not on memorization and rote application of problem-
                        solving techniques. Examples could include the proportion of ingredients combined in baked goods or the
                        combustion of fuels.
                        Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking, Chemical Reactions, Energy and Matter

                        the energy released during the processes of fission, fusion, and radioactive decay.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on simple qualitative models, such as pictures or diagrams and on the scale
                        of energy released in nuclear processes relative to other kinds of transformations. Examples could include
                        radon gas in basements, thorium in white gas mantles or, historically, Wiscasset’s Maine Yankee nuclear
                        power plant and Fukushima in Japan.

                        down other objects. Examples of solutions
                        could include tools such as a ramp to
                        increase the speed of the object and a

                        MS-PS2-2 Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the change in an object’s motion depends on
                        the sum of the forces on the object and the mass of the object.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on balanced (Newton’s First Law) and unbalanced forces in a system,
                        qualitative comparisons of forces, mass and changes in motion (Newton’s Second Law), frame of reference,
                        and specification of units.

                        Further explanation: Examples of devices that use electrical and magnetic forces could include electromagnets,
                        electric motors, or generators. Examples of data could include the effect of the number of turns of wire on the
                        strength of an electromagnet, or the effect of increasing the number or strength of magnets on the speed of an
                        electric motor. Possible explorations include the effects of living near high tension power lines, the similarities
                        found in hydroelectric generators and wind turbines or the growing electric car market in Maine.

                        interactions are attractive and depend on the masses of interacting objects.
                        Further explanation: Examples of evidence for arguments could include data generated from simulations or
                        digital tools and charts displaying mass, strength of interaction, distance from the Sun, and orbital periods of
                        objects within the solar system. Examples include the gravitational effects of the moon on Maine tides.

Expectations            mathematical relationship among the net force on a macroscopic object, its mass, and its acceleration.
                        Further explanation: Examples of data could include tables or graphs of position or velocity as a function of time
                        for objects subject to a net unbalanced force, such as a falling object, an object rolling down a ramp, or moving
                        object being pulled by a constant force. Examples could include the acceleration of a snowmobile in different
                        gears (same mass with different forces creating different accelerations) or the comparison of gas mileage
                        between a truck vs a truck hauling a boat (same acceleration with different masses).

                        HS-PS2-2 Use mathematical representations to support the claim that the total momentum of a system
                        of objects is conserved when there is no net force on the system.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on the quantitative conservation of momentum in interactions and the
                        qualitative meaning of this principle. Examples could include jumping off a boat or canoe and the total momenta
                        of all the various pieces exploding from fireworks.

                        Further explanation: Examples of evaluation and refinement could include determining the success of a device
                        at protecting an object from damage and modifying the design to improve it. Examples of a device could include
                        a football helmet or a parachute. Examples could also include the barriers on the sides of NASCAR tracks,
                        truck safety hills on the sides of highways, bike helmets or car bumpers.

                        describe and predict the gravitational and electrostatic forces between objects.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on both quantitative and conceptual descriptions of gravitational and electrical
                        fields.

                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on descriptive relationships between kinetic energy and mass separately from
                        kinetic energy and speed. Examples could include riding a bicycle at different speeds, rolling different sizes of
                        rocks downhill, and getting hit by a whiffle ball versus a tennis ball. Consider different sized skiers or different
                        vehicles from pulp trucks to personal cars.

                        changes, different amounts of potential energy are stored in the system.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on relative amounts of potential energy, not on calculations of potential
                        energy. Examples of objects within systems interacting at varying distances could include the Earth and either
                        a roller coaster cart at varying positions on a hill or objects at varying heights on shelves, changing the
                        direction/orientation of a magnet, and a balloon with static electrical charge being brought closer to a
                        classmate’s hair. Examples of models could include representations, diagrams, pictures, and written

                        Further explanation: Examples of devices could include an insulated box, a solar cooker, and a Styrofoam cup.
                        Possible explorations could include insulating outerwear and clothing for winter sports or emergency shelters

                        Further explanation: Examples of experiments could include comparing final water temperatures after different
                        masses of ice melted in the same volume of water with the same initial temperature, the temperature change of
                        samples of different materials with the same mass as they cool or heat in the environment, or the same

                        representation of the energy before and after the transfer in the form of temperature changes or motion of an
                        object.

                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on explaining the meaning of mathematical expressions used in the model.
                        Examples could include wind turbines, hydroelectric or tidal power. Further examples could be found in
                        FunTown USA roller coasters or any sport (e.g. why a hockey puck changes motion, a baseball being hit, etc.).

                        for as a combination of energy associated with the motions of particles (objects) and energy associated
                        with the relative position of particles (objects).
                        Further explanation: Examples of phenomena at the macroscopic scale could include the conversion of kinetic
                        energy to thermal energy, the energy stored due to position of an object above the earth, and the energy stored
                        between two electrically-charged plates. Examples of models could include diagrams, drawings, descriptions,
                        and computer simulations.

                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of devices. Examples of
                        devices could include Rube Goldberg devices, wind turbines, solar cells, solar ovens, and generators.
                        Examples of constraints could include use of renewable energy forms and efficiency. Consider the Wind Blade

                        uniform energy distribution among the components in the system (second law of thermodynamics).
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on analyzing data from student investigations and using mathematical
                        thinking to describe the energy changes both quantitatively and conceptually. Examples of investigations could
                        include mixing liquids at different initial temperatures or adding objects at different temperatures to water. Other
                        examples can be found in heat pumps for radiant heat systems, insulation (to prevent heat transfer) or the use
                        of hot rocks to warm a tent when camping.

                       different energies, and the damage to living tissue from electromagnetic radiation depends on the energy of the
                       radiation. Examples of published materials could include trade books, magazines, web resources, videos, and
                       other passages that may reflect bias. Arguments around evidence could be made for dangers of cell phone
                       usage or living near high voltage power lines.

                       probability of successful reproduction of animals and plants, respectively.
                       Further explanation: Examples of behaviors that affect the probability of animal reproduction could include nest
                       building to protect young from cold, herding of animals to protect young from predators, and vocalization of
                       animals and colorful plumage to attract mates for breeding. Examples of animal behaviors that affect the
                       probability of plant reproduction could include transferring pollen or seeds and creating conditions for seed
                       germination and growth. Examples of plant structures could include bright flowers attracting butterflies that
                       transfer pollen, flower nectar and odors that attract insects that transfer pollen, and hard shells on nuts that
                       squirrels bury. Potential Maine connections could include herding of white-tail deer and caribou, vocalizations of
                       moose and cardinals, and keystone species such as those on the coast (e.g. harbor seals and sea stars).

                       factors influence the growth of organisms.
                       Further explanation: Examples of local environmental conditions could include availability of food, light, space,
                       and water. Examples of genetic factors could include large breed cattle and species of grass affecting the
                       growth of organisms. Examples of evidence could include drought decreasing plant growth, fertilizer increasing
                       plant growth, different varieties of plant seeds growing at different rates in different conditions, and fish growing
                       larger in large ponds than in small ponds. Examples could include winter and cold temperatures, hibernation
                       (e.g. black bear), and the migration of hummingbirds and Canada geese.

                        delivery, and organism movement in response to neural stimuli. An example of an interacting system could be
                        an artery depending on the proper function of elastic tissue and smooth muscle to regulate and deliver the
                        proper amount of blood within the circulatory system. Another example could be the water and nutrient intake in
                        soft shell clams.

                        HS-LS1-3 Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that feedback mechanisms maintain
                        homeostasis.
                        Further explanation: Examples of investigations could include heart rate response to exercise, stomate
                        response to moisture and temperature, and root development in response to water levels. Another example is
                        commonly observed in the daphnia heart rate response to changes in temperature, caffeine, alcohol, or
                        nicotine.

                        HS-LS1-5 Use a model to illustrate how photosynthesis transforms light energy into stored chemical
                        energy.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on illustrating inputs and outputs of matter and the transfer and transformation
                        of energy in photosynthesis by plants and other photosynthesizing organisms. Examples of models could
                        include diagrams, chemical equations, and conceptual models. Models may focus on Maine based economy of
                        photosynthetic organisms such as seaweeds, potatoes and pine trees.

                        HS-LS1-6 Construct and revise an explanation based on evidence for how carbon, hydrogen, and
                        oxygen from sugar molecules may combine with other elements to form amino acids and/or other large
                        carbon-based molecules.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on using evidence from models and simulations to support explanations.

                        Energy and Matter
                        HS-LS1-7 Use a model to illustrate that cellular respiration is a chemical process whereby the bonds of
                        food molecules and oxygen molecules are broken and the bonds in new compounds are formed
                        resulting in a net transfer of energy.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on the conceptual understanding of the inputs and outputs of the process of
                        cellular respiration. An example could be a moose eating a lily pad, the lily pad producing energy for the moose
                        and the breathing of oxygen by the moose to enable the process of cellular respiration.

                       historical data sets. Examples could include a look at historical data of the population of a species that has
                       moved north into Maine, such as opossum, and how it has changed as the climate in Maine has changed.
                       Observe data of the populations of harbor seals and the effect that a hunting ban has had on their population
                       and the resulting increase in the number of large predatory sharks in the Gulf of Maine.

                       Proportion, and Quantity
                       HS-LS2-2 Use mathematical representations to support and revise explanations based on evidence
                       about factors affecting biodiversity and populations in ecosystems of different scales.
                       Further explanation: Examples of mathematical representations include finding the average, determining
                       trends, and using graphical comparisons of multiple sets of data. Examples could include a graphical analysis
                       of historical data on the population of trout and/or landlocked salmon before and after the introduction of bass
                       into Moosehead Lake. Or data on a variety of populations (biodiversity) affected by dredging for sea scallops.

                       energy in aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on conceptual understanding of the role of aerobic and anaerobic respiration
                       in different environments. An example could include a classroom lab activity around a Winogradsky Column
                       with groups changing a variable such as temperature or light. Additional examples could look at the
                       fermentation processes when blue-green algae is grown in aerobic and anaerobic environments.

                       Energy and Matter
                       HS-LS2-4 Use mathematical representations to support claims for the cycling of matter and flow of
                       energy among organisms in an ecosystem.
                       Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using a mathematical model of stored energy in biomass to describe the
                       transfer of energy from one trophic level to another and that matter and energy are conserved as matter cycles
                       and energy flows through ecosystems. Emphasis is on atoms and molecules such as carbon, oxygen,
                       hydrogen and nitrogen being conserved as they move through an ecosystem. An example could include an
                       illustration of a food pyramid students may find in Maine (e.g. seaweed → snail → fish → shark, or grass →
                       insects → turkeys → foxes).

                       of carbon among the biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere.
                       Further explanation: Examples of models could include simulations and mathematical models. Models may
                       include multi-media illustration of the carbon cycle to include a Maine ecosystem they are familiar with such as
                       pond, seaside, farm, forest, etc.
                       Developing and Using Models, Cycles of Matter and Energy Transfer, Energy in Chemical Processes, Systems
                       and System Models
                       HS-LS2-6 Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning that the complex interactions in ecosystems
                       maintain relatively consistent numbers and types of organisms in stable conditions, but changing
                       conditions may result in a new ecosystem.
                       Further explanation: Examples of changes in ecosystem conditions could include modest biological or physical
                       changes, such as moderate hunting or a seasonal flood; and extreme changes, such as volcanic eruption or
                       sea level rise. Examples could include how the number of moose hunting licenses impacts other populations or
                       how fishing limits or shortened seasons decreases the catch of many fish species and the effects on ground
                       fish or smaller fish.

                       environment and biodiversity.
                       Further explanation: Examples of human activities can include urbanization, building dams, and dissemination
                       of invasive species. Potential Maine connections include the effects of: salting the roads in winter, introducing
                       green crabs into coastal waters, introducing invasive species into Maine lakes, or examining historical data on
                       water pollution in the Androscoggin during the height of mill activity, closing of mills and legislation on water
                       quality.

                       HS-LS2-8 Evaluate the evidence for the role of group behavior on individual and species’ chances to
                       survive and reproduce.
                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on: (1) distinguishing between group and individual behavior, (2) identifying
                       evidence supporting the outcomes of group behavior, and (3) developing logical and reasonable arguments
                       based on evidence. Examples of group behaviors could include flocking, schooling, herding, and cooperative
                       behaviors such as hunting, migrating, and swarming. Examples could include turkeys flocking to evade hunters
                       or Canada geese migrating to and through Maine for breeding purposes.

                        have traits inherited from parents and that
                        variation of these traits exists in a group of
                        similar organisms.
                        Further Explanation: Patterns are the
                        similarities and differences in traits shared
                        between offspring and their parents, or among

                        An example is how cystic fibrosis (one of the most common autosomal recessive inherited diseases in Maine)
                        is passed from parents to child.

                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on synthesizing information from reliable sources about the influence of
                       humans on genetic outcomes in artificial selection (such as genetic modification, animal husbandry, and gene
                       therapy) and on the impacts these technologies have on society as well as the technologies leading to these

                        to common ancestry and biological evolution. Examples of evidence could include similarities in DNA
                        sequences, anatomical structures, and order of appearance of structures in embryological development.

                        HS-LS4-2 Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results
                        from four factors: (1) the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic
                        variation of individuals in a species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3) competition for limited
                        resources, and (4) the proliferation of those organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce in
                        the environment.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on using evidence to explain the influence each of the four factors has on
                        number of organisms, behaviors, morphology, or physiology in terms of ability to compete for limited resources
                        and subsequent survival of individuals and adaptation of species. Examples of evidence could include
                        mathematical models such as simple distribution graphs and proportional reasoning.

                        advantageous heritable trait tend to increase in proportion to organisms lacking this trait.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on analyzing shifts in numerical distribution of traits and using these shifts as
                        evidence to support explanations. Observe historical data for the distribution of humpback whales in the Gulf of
                        Maine looking specifically at skin pigmentation.

                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on using data to provide evidence for how specific biotic and abiotic
                       differences in ecosystems (such as ranges of seasonal temperature, long-term climate change, acidity, light,
                       geographic barriers, or evolution of other organisms) contribute to a change in gene frequency over time,
                       leading to adaptation of populations.

                       HS-LS4-5 Evaluate the evidence supporting claims that changes in environmental conditions may
                       result in: (1) increases in the number of individuals of some species, (2) the emergence of new species
                       over time, and (3) the extinction of other species.
                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on determining cause and effect relationships for how changes to the
                       environment such as deforestation, fishing, application of fertilizers, drought, flood, and the rate of change of
                       the environment affect distribution or disappearance of traits in species.

                        lifetimes of other stars, as well as the ways that the sun’s radiation varies due to sudden solar flares (“space

                        indication that the universe is currently expanding, the cosmic microwave background as the remnant radiation
                        from the Big Bang, and the observed composition of ordinary matter of the universe, primarily found in stars
                        and interstellar gases (from the spectra of electromagnetic radiation from stars), which matches that predicted

                        ancient core (a result of past plate interactions). Examples could also be found from looking at differences
                        between coastal Maine and interior Maine rock types and their ages as evidence to explain the formation of

                       Further explanation: Examples of data include similarities of rock and fossil types on different continents, the
                       shapes of the continents (including continental shelves), and the locations of ocean structures (such as ridges,
                       fracture zones, and trenches). Potential Maine connections can be found in the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank
                       and the inner continental shelf.
                       Analyzing and interpreting data, the history of planet earth, plate tectonics and large-scale system interactions,
                       patterns
                       MS-ESS2-4 Develop a model to describe the cycling of water through Earth’s systems driven by energy
                       from the sun and the force of gravity.
                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on the ways in which water changes its state as it moves through the multiple
                       pathways of the hydrologic cycle. Examples of models can be conceptual or physical.
                       Developing and using models, the roles of water in earth’s surface processes, energy and matter
                       MS-ESS2-5 Collect data to provide evidence for how the motions and complex interactions of air
                       masses result in changes in weather conditions.
                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on how air masses flow from regions of high pressure to low pressure,
                       causing weather (defined by temperature, pressure, humidity, precipitation, and wind) at a fixed location to
                       change over time and how sudden changes in weather can result when different air masses collide. Emphasis
                       is on how weather can be predicted within probabilistic ranges. Examples of data can be provided to students
                       (such as weather maps, diagrams, and visualizations) or obtained through laboratory experiments (such as with
                       condensation). Potential Maine connections include “Bombogenesis” snow storms, coastal fog, Nor’easters,
                       sea smoke and valley fog.

                        cause and effect
                        MS-ESS2-6 Develop and use a model to describe how unequal heating and rotation of the Earth cause
                        patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that determine regional climates.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on how patterns vary by latitude, altitude, and geographic land distribution.
                        Emphasis of atmospheric circulation is on the sunlight-driven latitudinal banding, the Coriolis effect, and
                        resulting prevailing winds; emphasis of ocean circulation is on the transfer of heat by the global ocean
                        convection cycle, which is constrained by the Coriolis effect and the outlines of continents. Examples of models
                        can be diagrams, maps and globes, or digital representations.
                        Developing and using models, the roles of water in earth’s surface processes, weather and climate, systems

Performance             HS-ESS2-1 Develop a model to illustrate how Earth’s internal and surface processes operate at different
Expectations            spatial and temporal scales to form continental and ocean-floor features.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on how the appearance of land features (such as mountains, valleys, and
                        plateaus) and sea floor features (such as trenches, ridges, and seamounts) are a result of both constructive
                        forces (such as volcanism, tectonic uplift, and orogeny) and destructive mechanisms (such as weathering,
                        mass wasting, and coastal erosion). An example could be to utilize Maine Geologic maps, including tectonic
                        maps, as data to create a model to illustrate how Maine’s land features or oceanic features were formed.
                        Consider looking to Maine’s glacial history, features formed and materials deposited by glaciers.
                        Developing and Using Models, Plate Tectonics and Large-Scale System Interactions, Earth Materials and
                        Systems, Stability and Change
                        HS-ESS2-2 Analyze geoscience data to make the claim that one change to Earth’s surface can create
                        feedbacks that cause changes to other Earth systems.
                        Further explanation: Examples should include climate feedbacks, such as how an increase in greenhouse
                        gases causes a rise in global temperatures that melts glacial ice, which reduces the amount of sunlight
                        reflected from Earth’s surface, increasing surface temperatures and further reducing the amount of ice.
                        Examples could also be taken from other system interactions, such as how the loss of ground vegetation


05 -071 Chapter 132 - Learning Results : Parameters for Essential Instruction and State Accountability                        Page 150 of 225
                       causes an increase in water runoff and soil erosion; how dammed rivers increase groundwater recharge,
                       decrease sediment transport, and increase coastal erosion; and how the loss of wetlands causes a decrease in
                       local humidity that further reduces the wetlands’ extent. An example could consider timber harvesting practices
                       related to erosion and water runoff issues, river damming, or coastal erosion of Maine’s beaches and dunes.
                       Analyzing and Interpreting Data, Earth Materials and Systems, Stability and Change
                       HS-ESS2-3 Develop a model based on evidence of Earth’s interior to describe the cycling of matter by
                       thermal convection.
                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on both a one-dimensional model of Earth, with radial layers determined by
                       density, and a three-dimensional model, which is controlled by mantle convection and the resulting plate
                       tectonics. Examples of evidence include maps of Earth’s three-dimensional structure obtained from seismic
                       waves, records of the rate of change of Earth’s magnetic field (as constraints on convection in the outer core),
                       and identification of the composition of Earth’s layers from high-pressure laboratory experiments.

                       Interactions, Wave Properties, Energy and Matter
                       HS-ESS2-4 Use a model to describe how variations in the flow of energy into and out of Earth’s
                       systems result in changes in climate.
                       Further explanation: Examples of the causes of climate change differ by timescale, over 1-10 years; large
                       volcanic eruptions, ocean circulation; 10s to 100s of years: changes in human activity, ocean circulation, solar
                       output; 10s a-100s of thousands of years: changes to Earth’s orbit and the orientation of its axis; and 10s-100s
                       of millions of years: long-term changes in atmospheric composition. Consider the climatic impacts of the Gulf
                       stream and the Labrador currents on the Gulf of Maine, e.g. water temperature changes and fishing industry
                       disruptions.

                       Climate, Scale, Proportion, and Quantity
                       HS-ESS2-5 Plan and conduct an investigation of the properties of water and its effects on Earth
                       materials and surface processes.
                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on mechanical and chemical investigations with water and a variety of solid
                       materials to provide evidence for the connections between the hydrologic cycle and system interactions
                       commonly known as the rock cycle. Examples of mechanical investigations include stream transportation and
                       deposition using a stream table, erosion using variations in soil moisture content, and frost wedging by the


05 -071  Chapter 132 - Learning Results : Parameters for Essential Instruction and State Accountability                           Page 151 of 225
                        expansion of water as it freezes. Examples of chemical investigations include chemical weathering and
                        recrystallization (by testing the solubility of different materials) or melt generation (by examining how water
                        lowers the melting temperature of most solids). Draw connections to Maine phenomena such as ice jams, frost
                        heaves and potholes.

                        HS-ESS2-6 Develop a quantitative model to describe the cycling of carbon among the hydrosphere,
                        atmosphere, geosphere, and biosphere.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on modeling biogeochemical cycles that include the cycling of carbon through
                        the ocean, atmosphere, soil, and biosphere (including humans), providing the foundation for living organisms.
                        Developing and Using Models, Weather and Climate, Energy and Matter
                        HS-ESS2-7 Construct an argument based on evidence about the simultaneous coevolution of Earth’s
                        systems and life on Earth.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on the dynamic causes, effects, and feedbacks between the biosphere and
                        Earth’s other systems, whereby geoscience factors control the evolution of life, which in turn continuously alters
                        Earth’s surface. Examples include how photosynthetic life altered the atmosphere through the production of
                        oxygen, which in turn increased weathering rates and allowed for the evolution of animal life; how microbial life
                        on land increased the formation of soil, which in turn allowed for the evolution of land plants; and how the
                        evolution of corals created reefs that altered patterns of erosion and deposition along coastlines and provided
                        habitats for the evolution of new life forms.

                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on how these resources are limited and typically non-renewable and on how
                       their distributions are significantly changing as a result of removal by humans. Examples of uneven distributions
                       of resources as a result of past processes include but are not limited to petroleum (locations of the burial of
                       organic marine sediments and subsequent geologic traps), metal ores (locations of past volcanic and
                       hydrothermal activity associated with subduction zones), and soil (locations of active weathering and/or
                       deposition of rock).
                       Constructing explanations and designing solutions, natural resources, cause and effect
                       MS-ESS3-2 Analyze and interpret data on natural hazards to forecast future catastrophic events and
                       inform the development of technologies to mitigate their effects.
                       Further explanation: Emphasis is on how some natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions, and severe
                       weather, are preceded by phenomena that allow for reliable predictions, but others, such as earthquakes, occur
                       suddenly and with no notice and thus are not yet predictable. Examples of natural hazards can be taken from
                       interior processes (such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions), surface processes (such as mass wasting and
                       tsunamis), or severe weather events (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods). Examples of data can include
                       the locations, magnitudes, and frequencies of the natural hazards. Examples of technologies can be global
                       (such as satellite systems to monitor hurricanes or forest fires) or local (such as building basements in tornado-
                       prone regions or reservoirs to mitigate droughts).
                       Analyzing and interpreting data, natural hazards, patterns
                       MS-ESS3-3 Apply scientific principles to design a method for monitoring and minimizing a human
                       impact on the environment.
                       Further explanation: Examples of the design process include examining human environmental impacts,
                       assessing the kinds of solutions that are feasible, and designing and evaluating solutions that could reduce that
                       impact. Examples of human impacts can include water usage (such as the withdrawal of water from streams
                       and aquifers or the construction of dams and levees), land usage (such as urban development, agriculture, or
                       the removal of wetlands), and pollution (such as of the air, water, or land).
                       Constructing explanations and designing solutions, human impacts on earth systems, cause and effect
                       MS-ESS3-4 Construct an argument supported by evidence for how increases in human population and
                       per-capita consumption of natural resources impact Earth’s systems.
                       Further explanation: Examples of evidence include grade-appropriate databases on human populations and the
                       rates of consumption of food and natural resources (such as freshwater, mineral, and energy). Examples of
                       impacts can include changes to the appearance, composition, and structure of Earth’s systems as well as the
                       rates at which they change. The consequences of increases in human populations and consumption of natural

                        resources are described by science, but science does not make the decisions for the actions society takes.
                        Engaging in argument from evidence, human impacts on earth systems, cause and effect

                        temperatures over the past century.
                        Further explanation: Examples of factors include human activities (such as fossil fuel combustion, cement
                        production, and agricultural activity) and natural processes (such as changes in incoming solar radiation or
                        volcanic activity). Examples of evidence can include tables, graphs, and maps of global and regional
                        temperatures, atmospheric levels of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, and the rates of human
                        activities. Emphasis is on the major role that human activities play in causing the rise in global temperatures.

Performance             HS-ESS3-1 Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources,
Expectations            occurrence of natural hazards, and changes in climate have influenced human activity.
                        Further explanation: Examples of key natural resources include access to fresh water (such as rivers, lakes,
                        and groundwater), regions of fertile soils such as river deltas, and high concentrations of minerals and fossil
                        fuels. Examples of natural hazards can be from interior processes (such as volcanic eruptions and
                        earthquakes), surface processes (such as tsunamis, mass wasting and soil erosion), and severe weather (such
                        as hurricanes, floods, and droughts). Examples of the results of changes in climate that can affect populations
                        or drive mass migrations include changes to sea level, regional patterns of temperature and precipitation, and
                        the types of crops and livestock that can be raised. Other examples include the impacts of climate change on
                        Maine’s ski industry, fishing industry, maple sugar industry and on sea levels or droughts.
                        Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions, Natural Resources, Natural Hazards, Cause and Effect
                        HS-ESS3-2 Evaluate competing design solutions for developing, managing, and utilizing energy and
                        mineral resources based on cost-benefit ratios.
                        Further explanation: Emphasis is on the conservation, recycling, and reuse of resources (such as minerals and
                        metals) where possible, and on minimizing impacts where it is not. Examples include developing best practices
                        for agricultural soil use (for farming, timber industry, blueberry and potato crops), mining (for coal, tar sands,
                        and oil shales), and pumping (for petroleum and natural gas). Science knowledge indicates what can happen in

                       natural systems—not what should happen.
                       Engaging in Argument from Evidence, Natural Resources, Developing Possible Solutions
                       HS-ESS3-3 Create a computational simulation to illustrate the relationships among management of
                       natural resources, the sustainability of human populations, and biodiversity.
                       Further explanation: Examples of factors that affect the management of natural resources include costs of
                       resource extraction and waste management, per-capita consumption, and the development of new
                       technologies. Examples of factors that affect human sustainability include agricultural efficiency, levels of
                       conservation, and urban planning. Consider the effects of urban sprawl and the loss of farmland.
                       Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking, Human Impacts on Earth Systems, Stability and Change
                       HS-ESS3-4 Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on
                       natural systems.
                       Further explanation: Examples of data on the impacts of human activities could include the quantities and types
                       of pollutants released, changes to biomass and species diversity, or areal changes in land surface use (such as
                       for urban development, agriculture and livestock, or surface mining). Examples for limiting future impacts could
                       range from local efforts (such as reducing, reusing, and recycling resources) to large-scale geoengineering
                       design solutions (such as altering global temperatures by making large changes to the atmosphere or ocean).
                       Other examples include the use of propane-powered buses in Acadia (evaluate pros and cons).
                       Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions, Developing Possible Solutions, Stability and Change
                       HS-ESS3-5 Analyze geoscience data and the results from global climate models to make an evidence-
                       based forecast of the current rate of global or regional climate change and associated future impacts to
                       Earth systems.
                       Further explanation: Examples of evidence, for both data and climate model outputs, are for climate changes
                       (such as precipitation and temperature) and their associated impacts (such as on sea level, glacial ice volumes,
                       or atmosphere and ocean composition).
                       Analyzing and Interpreting Data, Global Climate Change, Stability and Change
                       HS-ESS3-6 Use a computational representation to illustrate the relationships among Earth systems and
                       how those relationships are being modified due to human activity.
                       Further explanation: Examples of Earth systems to be considered are the hydrosphere, atmosphere,
                       cryosphere, geosphere, and/or biosphere. An example of the far-reaching impacts from a human activity is how
                       an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide results in an increase in photosynthetic biomass on land and an
                       increase in ocean acidification, with resulting impacts on sea organism health and marine populations. Use and

                        and the natural environment that may limit possible solutions.
                        Further explanation: To solve a problem it needs to have clearly defined set goals and limits. The more
                        limitations applied to a problem, the more elegant and successful the solution is likely to be. Limitations would
                        take into account potential impacts on the environment, social/cultural norms, and allowable interactions. The
                        application of science principles is to be used as a tool to verify solutions. Examples could include hydroelectric
                        dams as a viable, cost effective and ecologically friendly way to generate electrical power. However, the dam
                        holds fish populations from traveling freely through the environment. There is a need to provide a safe way for
                        aquatic life to pass by the hydroelectric turbine in a way that does not impact the electrical generation, the
                        original water flow of the river dammed, is cost effective to existing dam models, and has no negative impact on

                        Further explanation: Testing and data is used to evaluate the solutions or part of the solutions that best solve
                        the given problem. The data needs to be assessed and then used to modify, combine, and deny solutions and
                        then retested to arrive at the best possible solution within the constraints of the problem. Examples could
                        include tables, graphs, matrices, check lists, spreadsheets, public polls, Venn diagrams, mathematical models,

                        against the constraints. That test is then applied to a prototype or model to allow faults to be identified and then
                        corrected, frequently the combination of two or more solutions can produce a better solution and then retest it
                        to see if it is the best solution. Examples could include materials science testing (shear strength, compression

Introduction
The primary purpose of social studies is to develop the ability to make informed and reasoned decisions for the public good as citizens
of a culturally diverse, democratic society in an interdependent world (National Council of the Social Studies, 1994, p.3). According to
the National Council for the Social Studies, advocates of citizenship education cross the political spectrum, but they are bound by a
common belief that our democratic republic will not sustain unless students are aware of their changing cultural and physical
environments; know the past; read, write, and think deeply; and act in ways that promote the common good. (C3 Framework for Social
Studies, 2013). The great architects of American public education, such as Thomas Jefferson, Horace Mann, and John Dewey,
believed that every student must be well versed in our nation's history, the principles and practices which undergird support and sustain
citizenship, and the institutions that define our government. Understandings of commerce and geography were critical to their thinking
as well. In essence, Jefferson, Mann, and Dewey viewed the study of social studies as critical to the mission of public schools. Indeed,
they would applaud the inclusion of a "responsible and involved citizen" in the Guiding Principles, as well as social studies as one of
eight content areas in the Learning Results.
A strong Social Studies education depends upon a clear understanding of its interrelated disciplines and inclusion of the Guiding
Principles. Without knowledge of the geography and economics of earlier times, history offers only lists of people, events, and dates.
Without knowledge of history, the institutions of American government and the dynamics of today's global economy are difficult to
understand. Although social studies curricula vary in their breadth and depth, the Social Studies Standards reflect a focus on
government, history, geography, personal finance and economics as the pillars of the content, with other disciplines within the social
sciences deemed important, but not essential.
Guiding Principles
The Guiding Principles guide education in Maine and should be reflected throughout Social Studies curriculum. Examples of how
students can show evidence of those guiding principles in Social Studies may include:
A.      Clear and Effective Communicator: Students research and use background knowledge to give audiovisual presentations
about current and historical issues.


05 -071    Chapter 132 - Learning Results : Parameters for Essential Instruction and State Accountability                          Page 164 of 225
    B. Self-Directed and Lifelong Learner: Students generate questions and explore primary and secondary sources to answer
        those questions while demonstrating a growth mindset.
    C. Creative and Practical Problem Solver: Students draw conclusions about current and historical problems using valid research
        and critical thinking.
    D. Responsible and Involved Citizen: Students practice and apply the duties of citizenship through the exercise of constitutional
        rights.
    E. Integrative and Informed Thinker: Students compare and contrast to analyze point of view and differentiate between reliable
        and unreliable primary and secondary sources.
Performance Expectations that include the application of the Guiding Principles through Social Studies knowledge and skills are
denoted in the Standards with an asterisk (*).
Skills in Social Studies:
The application of skills in Social Studies is crucial to any curriculum. Best practices in Social Studies reflect curriculum, instruction, and
assessment that give students opportunities to demonstrate research and develop positions on current Social Studies issues. Students
will be asked to identify key words and concepts related to research questions and locate and access information by using text features.
Additionally, students will demonstrate facility with note-taking, organizing information, and creating bibliographies. Students will
distinguish between primary and secondary sources as well as evaluate and verify the credibility of the information found in print and
non-print sources. Equally important is that students use additional sources to resolve contradictory information.
Key Ideas in the Social Studies Standards:
Growth mindset - Our mindset includes beliefs about our abilities and qualities that include intelligence, creativity or musicality.
 Having a growth mindset means that students know that their abilities and strengths can change or develop, and that those changes
are within their control.
Understand - The word “understand” appears in performance expectations throughout the Social Studies Standards. It refers to a
variety of different levels on Bloom’s taxonomy of thinking and was used intentionally to serve as an umbrella term for the cognitive
demand that is described by the descriptors beneath the performance expectations. Look to the descriptors grade level expectation for
grades K-5 or to the grade span expectations in spans 6-8 and 9-12 (Foundational or Developmental as noted by “F” or “D”) to define
the level of cognitive demand for student performance.

Various -The Social Studies Standards refer to “various" peoples, nations, regions of the world, historical eras, and enduring themes.
School administrative units should develop a local curriculum that assists students in gaining a coherent, broad perspective on a variety
of peoples, nations, regions, historical eras, and enduring themes.
Major Enduring Themes - The term “major enduring themes” is used in several places in the Social Studies Standards. This term
refers to general topics or issues that have been relevant over a long period of time. Using a consistent set of themes can serve as a
framework within which other concepts, topics, and facts can be organized. It can also help students make connections between events
within and across historical eras, and use history to help make informed decisions. Four different lists of major themes are provided,
and schools may select from them based on their judgment of which list will best serve the learning of their students. The Civics and
Government, Personal Finance and Economics, Geography, and History Standards all include performance expectations that address
individual, cultural, international, and global connections. It will be up to the School Administrative Units to determine whether they use
these performance expectations as an opportunity to integrate across the disciplines of the social studies or address them separately.
The “enduring themes,” some of which overlap, include:
    •   Freedom and Justice
    •   Conflict and Compromise
    •   Technology and Innovation
    •   Unity and Diversity
    •   Continuity and Change Over Time
    •   Supply and Demand
Eras – School Administrative Units (SAU) should develop a coherent curriculum that provides students with a balanced exposure to the
major eras of United States and World History. The term “various eras” in this document refers to those eras that are selected by an
SAU to build a cohesive, balanced understanding. The “eras,” some of which overlap, include:

Spiraling K-12 - A course of study in which students will see the same topics throughout their school career, with each encounter
increasing in complexity and reinforcing previous learning. The Social Studies Standards and performance expectations have been
created in order to reflect a progression of increasing complexity from K-5 and between the 6-8, and 9-diploma grade spans.

1. Minimum instructional requirements. A comprehensive program of instruction must include a minimum 4-year program that meets
the curriculum requirements established by this chapter and any other instructional requirements established by the commissioner and
the school board. [2009, c. 313, §15 (AMD).]
2. Required subjects. Courses in the following subjects shall be provided in separate or integrated study programs to all students and
required for a high school diploma: …. Social studies and history, including American history, government, civics and personal finance--
2 years; [2013, c. 244, §1 (AMD).]
Title 20-A MRSA §4706, as amended by PL 1991, c. 655, §4, is further amended to read:
§4706. Instruction in American history, Maine studies and Maine Native American history.
The following subjects are required: …. Maine Studies… American History… Maine Native American history (including Maine tribal
governments, Maine Native American culture, Maine Native American territories, and Maine Native American economic systems).
 Maine Native American history and culture must be taught in all elementary and secondary schools, both public and private.
Maine Native Americans - The phrase “Maine Native Americans” refers to the four Maine Native American tribes – the Penobscot, the
Passamaquoddy, the Micmac, and the Maliseet.
Unity and Diversity - The Civics and Government, Economics, Geography, and History Standards all include performance indicators
that address individual, cultural, international, and global connections. It will be up to the SAU to determine whether they use these
performance indicators as an opportunity to integrate across the disciplines of the social studies or address them separately. In
whatever manner the SAU addresses the instruction related to these performance indicators, it is critical that schools understand the
importance of addressing the issues that both unify and divide. The following should help to provide clarity about the ideas related to
unity and diversity that are contained in these performance indicators.
        Unity and Diversity - The concepts of "unity" and "diversity" apply to the Civics and Government, Economics, Geography, and
        History Standards in Social Studies. Unity and diversity have long been valued in the United States as foundations of the unique
        character of our society. People throughout our nation's history have come from distinct and varied cultural, political, and
        religious backgrounds and perspectives. They have helped to shape and have participated in our national life based on the
        shared democratic values represented in our founding documents. We build common bonds of unity based on the democratic
        values, processes, and institutions that support our democratic way of life. At the same time we recognize the unique
        contributions, traditions, and perspectives of various groups and cultures. The concepts of unity and diversity also play a role in
        geography and economics. Diversity and unity influence the settlement and the economics of communities, regions, and nations.
        For example, in some cases a geographic factor such as a river serves as a resource that may bind a region, community, or a
        group of people of similar ethnic origins together. Economic systems or activities may unify a community or region; in other
        cases economic influences may lead to economic diversity. The Social Studies Standards define the essential knowledge related
        to the concepts of unity and diversity under the broad umbrella of the performance indicators set forth at B3, C2, D2, and E2


05 -071    Chapter 132 - Learning Results : Parameters for Essential Instruction and State Accountability                      Page 168 of 225
        which address Individual, Cultural, International, and Global Connections in civics and government, economics, geography, and
        history, respectively.
Embedded Definition of the Social Studies Disciplines - The first performance indicator of each of these disciplines includes a
descriptor that provides a definition of each of these disciplines that develops across the grade spans. This series of descriptors
provides a developmentally appropriate picture of what is learned in the discipline, and should help to ensure that students will be able

                                                            VISUAL AND PERFORMING ARTS
The visual and performing arts are an essential part of every child’s education. Engagement in the visual and performing arts deepens
students’ overall knowledge and skills, as well as their social and emotional development. Research shows that students involved in
the visual and performing arts are more successful in school, more involved in their communities, and perform better on standardized
tests.
The National Standards for Arts Education includes separate standards for dance, music, theatre, and visual arts. In 1997, the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Arts assessment was developed with separate assessments in these disciplines. These
four visual and performing arts disciplines are uniquely different from each other in literacy as well as creation and performance.
Standards A and B of the Visual and Performing Arts Standards of the Maine Learning Results each include four separate strands
(dance, music, theatre, and visual arts). In contrast, standards C, D, and E are representative of skills and knowledge in all four
disciplines of the visual and performing arts. This format best represents both the unique and common aspects of the visual and
performing arts. The decision about the breadth of the programming in the visual and performing arts resides with the School
Administrative Units (SAU).
These Visual and Performing Arts Standards outline a comprehensive pathway to enable every high school graduate to exhibit
proficiency in one or more of the visual and performing arts disciplines. The key to success is local commitment to the visual and
performing arts. Staffing, scheduling, and resources vary from SAU to SAU. Research supports the implementation of a
comprehensive visual and performing arts education curriculum to meet the learning needs of all students. Connecting the visual and
performing arts with other content areas of the curriculum improves teaching and learning.
This document guides SAUs in developing comprehensive and sequential standards-based visual and performing arts curricula for
student learning. The use of these standards may assist in the improvement of instruction generally, and impact student learning, not
only in the visual and performing arts but in other content areas, as well.

Language and communication are at the heart of the human experience whether communication occurs face-to-face, in writing, or
through the arts and media. Graduates of Maine’s publicly supported schools must have the linguistic and cultural skills to communicate
successfully in a pluralistic society at home and abroad. The need to understand and communicate with other peoples of the world is
more urgent today because of the forces of globalization. All students are expected to develop the level of proficiency defined in the
standards and performance indicators at the 9-Diploma grade span in at least one language other than English. To succeed, all
students must study language and culture in an integrated fashion beginning in the early elementary grades and extending through their
school experience. A PreK-Diploma structure in all schools is foundational to the State vision for world languages.
The major organizing principle in today's world language classrooms is communication. While knowledge of vocabulary and the
linguistic system remain essential tools for communication, learning to use a second language in meaningful and appropriate ways is
the ultimate goal of world language instruction. In any mode of communication, there are particular links between language usage and
knowledge of the associated culture(s). In the study of classical languages such as Latin or ancient Greek, proficiency will emphasize
the ability to understand the written language over oral communication and will recognize the linguistic and historical importance of the
language and the people who spoke it.
        Differentiation and Commonality Among World Languages – The World Languages Standards outline both common and
        unique descriptors for modern and classical languages. Distinctions between modern and classical languages are identified only
        where necessary to acknowledge significant differences in communication modes and resources. References in the
        performance indicators and descriptors of modern languages are inclusive of American Sign Language (ASL) except where
        otherwise noted.
        Multiple Entry Points - Throughout the World Languages Standards, the sequence of performance indicators is based on a
        PreK-Diploma course of study of mainly cognate languages (languages that contain words from two languages that are similar in


05 -071    Chapter 132 - Learning Results : Parameters for Essential Instruction and State Accountability                      Page 213 of 225
        spelling and meaning or sound and meaning). Some students may elect to participate in the study of more than one world
        language. In these instances, it is important to recognize that the PreK-Diploma grade span represents a continuum of learning.
        Students who begin a language later in the Pre-K-Diploma sequence of study and students who study a non-cognate language
        may not be able to reach the highest level performance indicators (9-Diploma) without additional language experiences –
        instructional or immersion – or a heritage language background. Students beginning additional world languages at grade 9 or
        above should not be held accountable for performance indicators at this level. Rather, curriculum, instruction, and assessment
        will need to be aligned to the grade span expectations that reflect the students’ level of proficiency and advance from that point
        to the standards and performance indicators defined in subsequent grade spans.
        Instruction and Support in the Target Language - All performance indicators for modern languages, with the exception of one
        (A4), are to be accomplished in the target language (the non-English language being studied by the student). Students engaged
        in a sequential PreK-Diploma modern language program are expected to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to
        communicate basic understandings for all performance indicators using target language at a level appropriate to the grade span.
        Proficiency in the study of classical languages, such as Latin or ancient Greek, emphasizes the ability to understand written
        language over oral communication although oral communication remains a component. Accordingly, performance indicators
        A2, A4, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, and D1 may be accomplished in the target language or English.
        Level of Discourse – Standard A outlines grade span proficiencies at grades PreK-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-Diploma for
        communication skills. The document assumes that as students learn the knowledge and skills outlined in Standards B, C, and
        D, they will do so by developing and using communication skills learned in Standard A, as appropriate to their grade span. By
        the end of the grade span, students should be able to demonstrate their proficiency of the standards and performance indicators
        related to Standards B, C, and D using communication skills learned in Standard A, as appropriate for the end of that grade
        span.
