The Role of Science Standards in Michigan
According to the dictionary, a standard is “something considered by an authority or by
general consent as a basis of comparison.” Today’s world is replete with standards
documents such as standards of care, standards of quality, and even standard operating
procedures. These various sets of standards serve to outline agreed-upon expectations,
rules, or actions, which guide practice and provide a platform for evaluating or
comparing these practices.
One such set of standards is the academic standards that a governing body may have for
the expected outcomes of students. In Michigan, these standards, are used to outline
learning expectations for Michigan’s students, and are intended to guide local curriculum
development and assessment of student progress. The Michigan Science Standards are
performance expectations for students. They are not curriculum and they do not specify
classroom instruction. Standards should be used by schools as a framework for
curriculum development with the curriculum itself prescribing instructional resources,
methods, progressions, and additional knowledge valued by the local community. Since
Michigan is a “local control” state, local school districts and public school academies can
use these standards in this manner to make decisions about curriculum, instruction, and
assessment.
At the state level, these standards provide a platform for state assessments, which are
used to measure how well schools are providing opportunities for all students to learn
the content outlined by the standards. The standards also impact other statewide
policies, such as considerations for teacher certification and credentials, school
improvement, and accountability, to name a few.
The standards in this document identify the student performance outcomes for students
in topics of science and engineering. These standards replace the Michigan Science
Standards adopted in 2006, which were published as the Grade Level Content
Expectations and High School Content Expectations for science.
Why These Standards?
There is no question that students need to be
prepared to apply basic scientific knowledge to their
lives and to their careers, regardless of whether they
are planning STEM based careers or not. In 2011, the
National Research Council released A Framework for
                                        v. 11/2015                             Page 4 of 34


K-12 Science Education, 1 which set forth guidance for science standards development
based on the research on how students learn best. This extensive body of research
suggests students need to be engaged in doing science by engaging the same practices
used by scientists and engineers. Furthermore, students should engage in science and
engineering practices in the context of core ideas that become ever more sophisticated
as students move through school. Students also need to see the connections of these
disciplinary-based core ideas to the bigger science concepts that cross disciplinary
lines. The proposed Michigan standards are built on this research-based framework.
The framework was used in the development of the Next Generation Science Standards,
for which Michigan was a lead partner. The Michigan Science Standards are derived
from this effort, utilizing the student performance expectations and their relevant coding
(for reference purposes). These standards are intended to guide local curricular design,
leaving room for parents, teachers, and schools to surround the standards with local
decisions about curriculum and instruction. Similarly, because these standards are
performance expectations, they will be used to guide state assessment development.
Organization and Structure of the Performance Expectations
Michigan’s science standards are organized by grade level K-5, and then by grade span
in middle school and high school. The K-5 grade level organization reflects the
developmental nature of learning for elementary students in a manner that attends to
the important learning progressions toward basic foundational understandings. By the
time students reach traditional middle school grades (6-8), they can begin to build on
this foundation to develop more sophisticated understandings of science concepts within
and across disciplines. This structure also allows schools to design local courses and
pathways that make sense for their students and available instructional resources.
Michigan’s prior standards for science were organized by grade level through 7th grade.
Because these standards are not a revision, but were newly designed in their entirety, it
was decided that the use of the grade level designations in the traditional middle grades
(6-8) would be overly inhibiting to apply universally to all schools in Michigan. Such
decisions do not specifically restrict local school districts from collaborating at a local or
regional level to standardize instruction at these levels. Therefore, it is recommended
that each school, district, or region utilize assessment oriented grade bands (K-2, 3-5, 6-
8, 9-12) to organize curriculum and instruction around the standards. MDE will provide
guidance on appropriate strategies or organization for such efforts to be applied locally in
each school district or public school academy.
Within each grade level/span the performance expectations are organized around topics.
While each topical cluster of performance expectations addresses the topic, the wording
of each performance expectation reflects the three-dimensions of science learning
outlined in A Framework for K-12 Science Education: cross-cutting concepts, disciplinary
core ideas, and science and engineering practices.

Cross Cutting Concepts (CCC)
The seven Crosscutting Concepts outlined by the Framework for K-12 Science
Education are the overarching and enduring understandings that provide an
organizational framework under which students can connect the core ideas from
the various disciplines into a “cumulative, coherent, and usable understanding of
science and engineering” (Framework, pg. 83).
These crosscutting concepts are…

Implementation
It is extremely important to remember that the research calls for instruction and
assessments to blend the three dimensions (CCC, DCI, and Practices). It is this working
together of the three dimensions that will allow all children to explain scientific
phenomena, design solutions to problems, and build a foundation upon which they can
continue to learn and be able to apply science knowledge and skills within and outside
the K-12 education arena. While each PE incorporates these three dimensions into its
wording, this alone does not drive student outcomes. Ultimately, student learning
depends on how the standards are integrated in instructional practices in the classroom.
There are several resources based on the National Research Council’s A Framework for
K-12 Science Education that were developed for educators to utilize in planning
curriculum, instruction, and professional development. These include resources
developed by Michigan K-12 and higher education educators, with plans to develop more
guided by the needs of the field as implementation moves forward. This includes
assessment guidance for the Michigan Department of Education, local districts, and
educators.
Michigan Specific Contexts
Because the student performance expectations were developed to align to a general
context for all learners, the Michigan Department of Education (MDE) works with a
variety of stakeholders to identify Michigan-specific versions of the standards for student
performance expectations that address issues directly relevant to our state such as its
unique location in the Great Lakes Basin, Michigan-specific flora and fauna, and our
state’s rich history and expertise in scientific research and engineering. These versions
of the performance expectations allow for local, regional, and state-specific contexts for
learning and assessment. In addition to the specific performance expectations that
frame more general concepts and phenomena in a manner that is directly relevant to our
state, there are also a number of performance expectations which allow for local,
regional, or state-specific problems to be investigated by students, or for students to
demonstrate understandings through more localized contexts. Both of these types of
performance expectations are identified in the following standards, as well as in the
accompanying guidance document, which also identifies both clarification statements and
assessment boundaries. The Michigan specific performance expectations should be used
by educators to frame local assessment efforts. State level assessments will specifically
address the performance expectations with Michigan-specific contexts.
MDE is collaborating with multiple statewide partners to generate a list of support
materials for the state standards that focuses on resources and potential strategies for
introducing or exploring DCIs through a local, regional, or statewide lens to make the
learning more engaging and authentic. These contextual connections are not included in
the specific performance expectations, as educators should merely use these as
recommendations for investigation with students, and assessment developers have the
opportunity to use these to develop specific examples or scenarios from which students
would demonstrate their general understanding. This approach provides the opportunity
for educators to draw upon Michigan’s natural environment and rich history and
resources in engineering design and scientific research to support student learning.

Michigan Educator Guidance
The Michigan Science Standards within this document are the performance
expectations for students in grades K-12 for science and engineering practices,
cross cutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas of science and engineering.
In order to be able to develop and guide instruction to address the standards for all
students, Michigan educators will need access to a range of guidance and resources that
provide additional support for the teaching and learning of science. This guidance will be
developed and shared with Michigan educators following the adoption of the proposed
standards. The MDE provides additional guidance based upon educator needs and
requests, and utilizes support from practicing Michigan educators and educational
leaders to develop such guidance or tools to aid in the implementation of the standards.
Accompanying this standards document will be a range of resources provided to
educators and assessment developers to help frame the learning context and
instructional considerations of the performance expectations. Such guidance will include
appropriate connections and references to the Science and Engineering Practices, the
Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCI), and Cross Cutting Concepts (CCC) that frame each
performance expectation. External partners, including the Michigan Mathematics and
Science Center Network, Michigan Science Teachers Association, and National Science
Teachers Association, and professional development providers in Michigan, will utilize the
coding references of the standards to provide additional resources to Michigan educators.
The MDE will provide ongoing support to educators through guidance and professional
learning resources, which will be updated regularly. Additional information and
references can be found at http://michigan.gov/science.

HS-LS3-2           Make and defend a claim based on evidence that inheritable genetic
                   variations may result from: (1) new genetic combinations through meiosis,

HS-LS4-2           Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution
                   primarily results from four factors: (1) the potential for a species to
                   increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a
                   species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3) competition for limited
                   resources, and (4) the proliferation of those organisms that are better able
                   to survive and reproduce in the environment.
HS-LS4-3           Apply concepts of statistics and probability to support explanations that

                   conditions may result in: (1) increases in the number of individuals of some
                   species, (2) the emergence of new species over time, and (3) the extinction
                   of other species.
