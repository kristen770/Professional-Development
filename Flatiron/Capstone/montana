Dear Colleagues:
I am pleased to present to you the 2016 Massachusetts Science and Technology/Engineering (STE) Curriculum
Framework. This Framework articulates statewide guidelines for STE learning, teaching, and assessment for the
Commonwealth’s public schools.
To prepare students for success in college, career, and civic life, the 2016 STE standards emphasize the need for
student engagement, relevance, rigor, and coherence in curriculum and instruction. The standards:
       • Focus on conceptual understanding and application of concepts.
       • Integrate disciplinary core ideas and practices to reflect the discipline of science.
       • Present coherent progressions of STE core ideas and practices from pre-K to high school.
       • Include each discipline in grade-level standards pre-K to grade 8.
       • Contribute to preparation for post-secondary success in college and careers.
       • Coordinate with the English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics standards.
The 2016 STE standards maintain much of the content of our prior STE standards with updates to reflect changes
identified by the field, changes in science and engineering over the past 15 years, and the addition of inquiry and
design skills that students need to successfully engage in this discipline in pre-K–12 classrooms, civic life, and
post-secondary opportunities. The 2016 STE standards strengthen the often-lauded standards Massachusetts has
relied on since 1996.
I would like to thank all of the individuals and groups that provided input, reviewed comments, and suggested
edits to the standards, as well as those who contributed to the sections of the Framework. This effort included
many representatives from across the state. The Department of Early Education and Care (EEC) and the
Department of Higher Education (DHE) were key collaborators to ensure a coherent perspective for all students.
I am grateful for the dedication and expertise of all the educators, professionals, scholars, and other participants
who engaged with the Department in this endeavor.
I believe a strong understanding of science and technology/engineering is critical for every student in the
Commonwealth. Every student must understand the world around them and be able to apply analytical and
innovative thinking to complex problems they will face in civic and career contexts. This Framework provides
guidance and resources intended to help educators and professionals prepare students for such success. Thank
you for your ongoing support for quality STE education and for your commitment to achievement of such
important goals for all students in the Commonwealth.
Sincerely,
Mitchell D. Chester, Ed.D.
Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education

Acknowledgments
The 2016 Massachusetts Science and Technology/Engineering Curriculum Framework is the result of the
contributions of many educators across the state. Because of the broad-based, participatory nature of
the revision process, this document cannot reflect all the views of every contributor; instead it reflects a
balanced synthesis of their suggestions. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education wishes
to thank all of the groups and individuals that contributed to the development of these standards: the
Science and Technology/Engineering Revision Panel; the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)
Advisory Group; the Mathematics and Science Advisory Council, as well as the Technology/Engineering
Advisory Council (later combined into the STEM Advisory Council); the curriculum and standards
subgroup of the Governor’s STEM Advisory Council; grade-span teacher groups; professional educational
associations and organizations; and all of the individual teachers, administrators, scientists, engineers,
science education faculty, informal education staff, parents, business and industry representatives, and
others who took the time to provide thoughtful comments and input during the development of the STE
standards and the Framework.

Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering 7


Science and Technology/Engineering Education for All
Students: The Vision
Our world has never been so complex, and scientific and technological reasoning have never been so
necessary to make sense of it all. It is self-evident that science, technology, and engineering (STE) are
central to the lives of all Massachusetts citizens when they analyze current events, make informed
decisions about healthcare, or decide to support public development of community infrastructure. By
the end of grade 12, all students must have an appreciation for the wonder of science, possess sufficient
knowledge of science and engineering to engage in public discussions on related issues, and be careful
consumers of scientific and technological information and products in their everyday lives. Students’ STE
experience should encourage and facilitate engagement in STE to prepare them for the reality that most
careers require some scientific or technical preparation, and to increase their interest in and
consideration of careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). All students,
regardless of their future education plan and career path, must have an engaging, relevant, rigorous,
and coherent pre-K–12 STE education to be prepared for citizenship, continuing education, and careers.
Qualities of Science and Technology/Engineering Education for
All Students
Student engagement with science and technology/engineering is a critical emphasis that can only be
achieved through quality curriculum and instruction. The standards attend to relevance, rigor, and
coherence, each of which has a corresponding implication for curriculum and instruction:
             Emphasis in STE Standards                        Implication for Curriculum and Instruction

Engagement
Students need regular opportunities to experience the dynamic, interdisciplinary nature of science and
technology/engineering. Curriculum and instruction should instill wonder in students about the world
around them through engaging and exciting learning experiences. Students should develop a passion
about the natural and designed world and model the inquisitive, analytical, and skeptical nature of
science. These goals can only be achieved through a rich and varied STE curriculum that includes
thoughtful hands-on and minds-on activities, laboratories, investigations, and design challenges.
Students take ownership and responsibility in their learning when they have a role in making decisions
and reflecting on their learning. Active engagement in learning promotes a “growth mindset” that allows
students to feel they can access content and develop skills, and thus succeed in STE. Instruction
designed for student engagement is key to achieving this.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering                               8


Relevance
Students often want to know why they are learning content in the classroom that seems unrelated to
the real world. To understand the world around them, and be more interested in learning about it, they
must have opportunities to apply their learning to relevant situations and contexts. The STE standards
emphasize the application of knowledge and skills that students need to be analytical thinkers and
problem solvers for issues that are crucial in today’s world. Relevance in curriculum and instruction is
also about meeting the needs of diverse learners, including minorities, females, and those on
Individualized Education Program, of low socioeconomic status, or otherwise not traditionally
represented in science, technology, and engineering.
To focus on relevance, the STE standards emphasize fewer core ideas over lists of discrete knowledge.
For example, understanding the function of living systems includes understanding the role of feedback
mechanisms. Feedback mechanisms in organisms allow them to remain stable and stay alive by making
changes to maintain appropriate internal conditions even as external conditions change. A similar
principle applies to ecosystems and to designed systems such as home heating and cooling systems. This
focus on interactions in living systems is different from an emphasis on identification of body parts or
components of an ecosystem. A focus on core ideas helps students to understand mechanisms and
causes underlying a range of phenomena and apply their content understandings to real-world and
novel situations (NRC, 2012).
Knowledge alone is not enough: students need to be able to act on that knowledge. Students need to be
able to apply science and engineering practices—skills that let them analyze a natural phenomenon or
designed system and determine underlying mechanisms and causes—in civic, college, and career
contexts. Coupling practice with content gives the context for performance, whereas practices alone are
activities and content alone is memorization. Quality STE education must attend to both in order for
students to successfully apply their learning to understand and analyze their world.
Rigor
Rigor in STE teaching and learning is achieved by relating conceptual understanding of core ideas
(content), science and engineering practices (skills), and application of those to the natural and designed
world. Such rigor is how students will be able to apply or transfer their school learning to civic, college,
and career contexts. The STE standards are explicitly designed to relate these three aspects in learning
outcomes; curriculum and instruction should do so as well.
Coherence
Quality STE education is purposefully designed to support a progression of learning over time. STE
education begins early, when children are natural investigators who build and ask questions in many
contexts. This should be nurtured through subsequent years. Students should be engaged in developing
and applying the science and engineering practices with the core ideas throughout pre-K–12. Every grade’s
STE education should build on the prior year, support the development of more sophisticated skills,
increase the opportunity to relate and use multiple practices at once, and provide more sophisticated
concepts and tasks in which to apply the practices. Integration of practices with concepts in purposeful
ways throughout pre-K–12 ensures that all students have the opportunity to learn and apply scientific and
technical reasoning in a wide array of contexts and situations that they need for postsecondary success.
This can only happen if curriculum and instruction is purposefully designed to be coherent across time.

Three Important Goals for All Students:
Civic Participation, College Preparation, and
Career Readiness
The goal of STE education is to develop scientifically and technologically literate citizens who can solve
complex, multidisciplinary problems and apply analytical reasoning and innovative thinking to real-world
applications needed for civic participation, college preparation, and career readiness.
Civic Participation
High-quality science and technology/engineering education relates student interests and experiences to
real-world problems and decisions. Research demonstrates the importance of embracing diversity as a
means of enhancing learning about science and the world, especially as society becomes progressively
more diverse (NRC, 2012, p. 29). Leveraging multiple relevant societal contexts from STE including
nature, the history of science, cultural and technological perspectives, and community issues, promotes
equity, deepens understanding through application, and builds student identity as members of active
civic and STE communities.
College Preparation
A quality STE education that integrates concepts and practices is critical to college preparation. The
College Board has highlighted the value of science and engineering practices in its work to define college
readiness: “In order for a student to be college-ready in science, he or she must…have knowledge of the
overarching ideas in the science disciplines (i.e., earth and space science, life science, physical science,
and engineering) and how the practices of science are situated within this content…” (College Board,
2010, p. 3). The Standards for College Success (College Board, 2009) and redesigned Advanced
Placement (AP) science courses (e.g., AP Biology Exam [College Board, 2015]) reflect the need to
integrate science practices. College Board expectations focus on understanding, rather than
memorization, and on the use of that understanding in the context of practices.
ACT has shown that postsecondary instructors greatly value the use of process or inquiry skills (science
and engineering practices)—in fact, that they value these skills equally to fundamental content. ACT
notes [sic]: “Postsecondary expectations clearly state the process and inquiry skill in science are critical
as well as rigorous understanding of fundamental (not advanced) science topics” (ACT, 2011, p. 9). The
critical role of practices in preparing students for success in college-level science is further echoed by
David Conley in College Knowledge (2005). Conley’s surveys of higher education faculty identified
students’ ability to conduct meaningful research and use practices that lead toward quality research as a
key college- and career-ready indicator.
The Admissions Standards for the Massachusetts University System and the University of Massachusetts
(www.mass.edu/forstufam/admissions/admissionsstandards.asp) also emphasize the need to include
both concepts and practices. They state that three science courses, incorporating laboratory work, must
be completed in order to fulfill the minimum science requirement for admission to the Commonwealth’s
four-year public institutions. All high school courses based on the standards presented in this document
should include substantive laboratory and/or fieldwork (see Appendix VII) to allow all students the
opportunity to meet or exceed this requirement.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering                               10


Career Readiness
Most jobs and postsecondary opportunities that provide a living wage now require an increased amount
of scientific and technical proficiency. The skills and background that students learn through their STE
education serve as the foundation for solving problems and understanding issues they will encounter in
their careers and will provide the intellectual tools needed to develop strategies for dealing with these
issues. The use of various forms of modeling and problem solving, both learned through STE practices,
applies to an infinite number of career paths, including those that not typically characterized as STE.
For those considering STEM careers, science and engineering practices are also receiving increased
attention in the context of STEM career preparation. A strong foundation in K–12 engagement and
learning will keep these opportunities open for students to pursue. The redesigned AP science curricula,
the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) publication Vision and Change (2011),
and the Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians (AAMC and HHMI, 2009) identify overlapping
science practices as key to postsecondary opportunities.
Students’ pre-K–12 STE experience should encourage and facilitate active engagement, relevant
contexts, rigorous expectations, and coherence to prepare them for the range of careers that now
require some scientific and technical preparation, and to increase students’ interest in and
consideration of STEM-specific careers.
Massachusetts’ Definition of College and Career Readiness
The Massachusetts definition for college and career readiness (www.doe.mass.edu/ccr/) includes
subject-specific components that articulate essential learning competencies (for mathematics and
English language arts, currently). The essential competencies for STE, developed during the standards
revision process with input from many stakeholders, define the STE component:
    Essential Competencies: Learning
    Students who are college and career ready in Science and Technology/Engineering will demonstrate
    the academic knowledge, skills, and practices necessary to enter into and succeed in entry-level,
    credit-bearing science, engineering or technical courses; certificate or workplace training programs
    requiring an equivalent level of science; or a comparable entry-level science or technical course at the
    institution. College and career ready students in Science and Technology/Engineering will be
    academically prepared to:
    •    Analyze scientific phenomena and solve technical problems in real-world contexts using relevant
         science and engineering practices and disciplinary core ideas.
    •    Use appropriate scientific and technical reasoning to support, critique, and communicate
         scientific and technical claims and decisions.
    •    Appropriately apply relevant mathematics in scientific and technical contexts.
Summary
A student’s ability to engage in scientific and technical reasoning through relevant experience results in
better understanding of science and engineering, increased mastery of sophisticated subject matter, a
better ability to explain the world, and increased interest in STEM fields. These are key outcomes for
successful engagement in civic, college, or career contexts.

Key Features of the STE Standards to
Promote the Vision
The science and technology/engineering standards are intended to drive engaging, relevant, rigorous,
and coherent instruction that emphasizes student mastery of both disciplinary core ideas (concepts) and
application of science and engineering practices (skills) to support student readiness for citizenship,
college, and careers. The STE standards embody several key features to support this goal, including a
number of features consistent with Massachusetts’ mathematics and English language arts (ELA)
standards:
1. The standards focus on conceptual understanding and application of concepts. The standards are
    focused on a limited set of disciplinary core ideas that build across grades and lead to conceptual
    understanding and application of concepts. They are written to both articulate the broad concepts
    and key components that specify expected learning. In particular, the disciplinary core ideas
    emphasize the principles students need to analyze and explain natural phenomena and designed
    systems they experience in the world.
2. Integration of disciplinary core ideas and practices reflects the interconnected nature of science and
    engineering. The standards integrate disciplinary core ideas with scientific and engineering
    practices. The integration of disciplinary core ideas and practices reflects how science and
    engineering are applied and practiced every day. It is shown to enhance student learning of both
    and results in rigorous learning expectations aligned with similar expectations in mathematics and
    ELA standards.
3. The standards emphasize preparation for postsecondary success for citizenship, college, and careers.
    The standards include science and engineering practices necessary to engage in scientific and
    technical reasoning, a key aspect of civic participation as well as college and career readiness. The
    standards articulate core ideas and practices students need to succeed in entry-level, credit-bearing
    science, engineering, or technical courses in college or university; certificate or workplace training
    programs requiring an equivalent level of science; or comparable entry-level science or technical
    courses, as well as jobs and postsecondary opportunities that require scientific and technical
    proficiency to earn a living wage.
4. STE core ideas and practices progress coherently from pre-K to high school. The standards emphasize
    a focused and coherent progression of concepts and skills from grade span to grade span, allowing
    for a dynamic process of knowledge and skill building throughout a student’s scientific education.
    The progression gives students the opportunity to learn more sophisticated material and
    reconceptualize their understanding of how the natural and designed world work, leading to the
    scientific and technical understanding and reasoning skills needed for postsecondary success.
5. Each discipline is included in grade-level standards for pre-K to grade 8. To achieve consistency
    across schools and districts and to facilitate collaboration, resource sharing, and effective education
    for transient populations, the pre-K to grade 8 standards are presented by grade level. All four
    disciplines (earth and space science, life science, physical science, and technology/engineering) are
    included in each grade to encourage integration across the year and through curriculum. This
    reflects the nature of science and engineering as experienced in every-day life and allows attention
    to crosscutting concepts that aid analysis of the world.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering                              12


6. The STE standards are coordinated with the Commonwealth’s ELA and mathematics standards. The
    STE standards require the use and application of ELA and mathematics to support STE learning. The
    three sets of standards overlap in meaningful and substantive ways, particularly in regard to
    practices that are consistent across all three, and offer an opportunity for all students to better
    apply and learn STE.
The Massachusetts economy, individual career paths, and civic life are all very dynamic; students’
education needs to be too. Quality science and technology/engineering education is needed at all grade
levels and should be a key emphasis of every academic program. An encompassing pre-K to high school
STE learning experience is essential for students to be prepared for citizenship, college, and careers.

Guiding Principles for Effective Science and
Technology/Engineering Education
Teaching and learning are at the heart of quality science and technology/engineering education. The
vision of the Massachusetts STE standards is to engage students in the core ideas through the
integration of science and engineering practices, while making connections to what they know and the
world they live in. The goal of the Guiding Principles is to help educators create relevant, rigorous, and
coherent STE programs that support student engagement, curiosity, analytical thinking, and excitement
for learning over time. Educators, administrators, and curriculum designers can refer to the Guiding
Principles to develop effective pre-K–12 STE programs. The Guiding Principles are organized to reflect
the need for relevance (Principles 1–2), rigor (Principles 3–5), and coherence (Principles 6–9) in STE
programs. Strong STE programs effectively support student learning so they are prepared for a dynamic
world.
Guiding Principle 1
(Relevance)
An effective science and technology/engineering program develops
students’ ability to apply their knowledge and skills to analyze and explain
the world around them.
Students are naturally curious and motivated to know more about the world in which they live. Asking
questions about everyday phenomena, issues, and how things work can provide rich science learning
opportunities for all students. An STE curriculum that is carefully designed around engaging, relevant,
real-world interdisciplinary questions increases student motivation, intellectual engagement, and sense
making. Learning theory research shows that expert knowledge is developed more effectively through
these interdisciplinary real-world connections than through isolated content or practice (e.g., NRC,
2012; Schwartz et al., 2009). Real applications of science—and rapid developments in STE fields such as
biotechnology, clean energy, medicine, forensics, agriculture, or robotics—can promote student interest
and demonstrate how the core ideas in science are applied in real-world contexts.
An integrated STE curriculum that reflects what we know about the learning of science and how mastery
develops over time promotes deeper learning in science (e.g., Wilson et al., 2010). Each domain of
science has its particular approach and area of focus. However, students need to understand that much
of the scientific and technological work done in the world draws on multiple disciplines.
Oceanographers, for instance, use their knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology, earth science, and
technology to chart the course of ocean currents. And when a community initiates a public works
project, such as removing a combined sewer overflow system, there are various aspects of physics,
biology, technology, and chemistry to consider. Connecting the domains of STE with one another and
with mathematical study, and to applications in the world, helps students apply, transfer, and adapt
their learning to new situations and problems.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering                              14


Guiding Principle 2
(Relevance)
An effective science and technology/engineering program addresses
students’ prior knowledge and preconceptions.
Students are innately curious about the world and wonder how things work. They may make
spontaneous, perceptive observations about natural objects and processes or designed objects and
systems, and can often be found taking things apart and reassembling them. In many cases, students
have developed mental models about how the world works. These mental models may be inaccurate or
incomplete, even though they make sense to the students, and inaccuracies can hinder learning.
Research show that children can hold on to misconceptions even while reproducing what they have
been taught are the “correct answers.” They may find a variety of ingenious ways to reconcile their
misconception with the correct knowledge. Teachers must be skilled at uncovering inaccuracies in
students’ prior knowledge and observations, and in devising experiences that will challenge inaccurate
beliefs and give students compelling reasons and evidence to redirect their learning along more
productive routes. Instruction that addresses something students may wonder about or a discrepant
event can inspire them to search for evidence and analyze information, to develop a reasonable
explanation. Students’ natural curiosity provides one entry point for learning experiences designed to
address students’ preconceptions in STE.
Advancing student learning is not only about “fixing” misconceptions about individual concepts. It is
about building and revising networks of concepts so students build interrelated ideas. A key assumption
of the standards is that concepts and practices progress over time, becoming more sophisticated and
scientific as students revise and reconceptualize their understandings. Recognizing that learners use
their experiences and background knowledge to actively construct meaning helps educators effectively
accommodate and address student prior knowledge and interests to enhance learning.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering                          15


Guiding Principle 3
(Rigor)
Investigation, experimentation, design, and analytical problem solving are
central to an effective science and technology/engineering program.
All students can develop proficiency in STE if instruction provides them with relevant and engaging
opportunities. This includes a range of scientific investigations and thinking, including—but not limited
to—inquiry and investigation, collection and analysis of evidence, analytical reasoning, and
communication and application of information. Investigations introduce students to the nature of
original research and design, increase students’ understanding of scientific and technological concepts,
promote skill development, and provide entry points for all learners. Lessons should be designed so that
knowledge and skills are developed and used together on a regular basis.
Research shows that students learn when they have the opportunity to reflect on how the practices
contribute to the accumulation of scientific knowledge. This means, for example, that when students
carry out an investigation, develop models, articulate questions, or engage in arguments, they have
opportunities to think about what they have done and why. Puzzlement and uncertainty are common
features in experimentation. Students need time to examine their ideas as they apply them in explaining
a natural phenomenon or solving a design problem. Opportunities for students to reflect on their own
ideas, collect evidence, make inferences and predictions, and discuss their findings are all crucial to
growth in understanding. These opportunities must be carefully chosen to link to important scientific
ideas and give students ample time to generate and interpret evidence and develop explanations of the
natural world through sustained investigations. It can also offer students an opportunity to monitor and
evaluate their work. Through this kind of reflection and active processing, students understand the
importance of each practice and develop a nuanced appreciation of the nature of science (also see
Appendix VIII).
Guiding Principle 4
(Rigor)
An effective science and technology/engineering program provides
opportunities for students to collaborate in scientific and technological
endeavors and communicate their ideas.
Scientists and engineers work as members of their professional communities. Ideas are tested, modified,
extended, and reevaluated by those professional communities over time. Thus, the ability to convey
ideas to others is essential for these advances to occur. In a classroom, student learning is advanced
through social interactions among students, teachers, and external experts. In order to learn how to
effectively communicate scientific and technological ideas, students require practice in making written
and oral presentations, fielding questions, responding to critiques, and developing replies. Students
need opportunities to talk about their work in focused discussions with peers and with those who have
more experience and expertise. This communication can occur informally, in the context of an ongoing
student collaboration or in an online consultation with a scientist or engineer, or more formally, when a
student presents findings from an individual or group investigation. Opportunities to collaborate and
communicate are critical to advance students’ STE learning.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering                             16


Guiding Principle 5
(Rigor)
An effective science and technology/engineering program conveys high
academic expectations for all students.
A high-quality education system simultaneously serves the goals of equity, excellence, and access for all
students. At every level of the education system, teachers should act on the belief that young people
from every background can learn rigorous STE content and engage in sophisticated analytical practices.
Teachers and guidance personnel should advise students and parents that rigorous courses in STE at all
grades will prepare them for success in college and the workplace, while elective and advanced courses
can help them enter a STEM field, if that is their goal. After-school, weekend, and summer enrichment
programs offered by school districts or communities may be especially valuable and should be open to
all. Schools and districts should also invite role models from business and the community to visit classes,
work with students, and contribute to STE instruction.
Regardless of whether students go on to an institute of higher education or to a workplace, they should
be equipped with the skills and habits required for postsecondary success. Skills, such as the ability to
work through difficult problems, to be creative in problem solving, and to think critically and analytically,
will serve students in any setting.
The STE standards are designed to include three interrelated components necessary for such
preparation: conceptual understanding of disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and
application to the natural and designed world. These components are illustrated in this graphic:
When students work toward high expectations in STE, they develop the foundations needed for success
after graduation.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering                             17


Guiding Principle 6
(Coherence)
An effective science and technology/engineering program integrates STE
learning with mathematics and disciplinary literacy.
Mathematics is an essential tool for scientists and engineers because it specifies in precise and abstract
(general) terms many attributes of natural phenomena and human-made systems. Mathematics
facilitates precise analysis and prediction through formulae that represent the nature of relationships
among components of a system (e.g., F = ma). Mathematics can also be used to quantify dimensions and
scale, allowing investigations of questions such as: How small is a bacterium? How large is a star? How
dense is lead? How fast is sound? How hard is a diamond? How sturdy is the bridge? How safe is the
plane? With such analyses, all kinds of intellectual and practical questions can be posed, predicted, and
solved.
In addition to mathematics, reading, writing, and communication skills are necessary elements of
learning and applying STE (also see Guiding Principle IV). Teachers should consistently support students
in acquiring comprehension skills and strategies to deepen students’ understanding of STE concepts as
represented and conveyed in a variety of texts. Scientific and technical texts contain specialized
knowledge that is organized in a specific way, including informational text, diagrams, charts, graphs, and
formulas. For example, scientific texts will often articulate a general principle that describes a pattern in
nature, followed by evidence that supports and illustrates the principle. STE classrooms make use of a
variety of text materials, including scientific and technical articles, journals, lab instructions, reports, and
textbooks. Texts are generally informational in nature, rather than narrative, and often include technical
information related to a particular phenomenon, process, or structure. Students should be able to use a
variety of texts to distinguish fact from opinion, make inferences, draw conclusions, and collect evidence
to test hypotheses and build arguments. Teachers should help students understand that the types of
texts students read, along with the reason(s) for reading these texts, are specific to STE. Supporting the
development of students’ literacy skills will help them to deepen their understanding of STE concepts.
Successful STE learning requires explicit opportunities to develop mathematics and disciplinary literacy
knowledge and skills (also see Appendix II).
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering                                 18


Guiding Principle 7
(Coherence)
An effective science and technology/engineering program uses regular
assessment to inform student learning, guide instruction, and evaluate
student progress.
Teaching without attention to learners’ perspectives and prior knowledge is like flying a plane in fog
without instruments.
Ball & Forzani, 2012
Assessment reflects classroom expectations and shows outcomes of student learning based on
established knowledge and performance goals. The learning standards in this Framework are a key
resource for setting such knowledge and performance objectives in STE. Assessment assists teachers in
improving classroom practice, planning curricula, developing self-directed learners, reporting student
progress, and evaluating programs. It provides students with feedback about how their knowledge and
skills are developing and what can be done to improve them. It lets parents know how well their
children are doing and what needs to be done to help them do better.
Diagnostic information gained from different types of assessment enables teachers to adjust their day-
to-day and week-to-week practices to foster greater student achievement. There are many types of
assessment, such as paper-and-pencil testing, performance assessments, interviews, and portfolios, as
well as less formal inventories such as regular observation of student responses to instruction. Given the
emphasis on science and engineering practices in the standards, performance-based assessments should
be developed that allow students to demonstrate what they have learned in the context of real-world
problems and applications.
Learning progressions recognize that learning requires revision of networks of understanding, not
revision of individual concepts (or misconceptions) (e.g., Alonzo & Gotwals, 2012; Corcoran et al., 2009;
NRC, 2012). If teachers understand where their students are in their understanding of core ideas, and
anticipate what students’ misconceptions and struggles may be (e.g., Driver et al., 1985, 1994; Keeley et
al., 2005; Stanford University, 2012), they can better differentiate instruction and provide scaffolding
that allows each student to develop an integrated and deeper understanding of the STE content. It is
important to remember that the assessment of the standards should be on understanding the full
disciplinary core ideas, not just the pieces in the context of practices.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering                             19


Guiding Principle 8
(Coherence)
An effective science and technology/engineering program engages all
students, pre-K through grade 12.
Students benefit from studying STE throughout all their years of schooling. Appendix VI discusses the
importance of science and engineering in early education. The standards are designed with coherent
progressions of learning across time, recognizing that learning requires developing networks of ideas
that develop and deepen over time. And the importance of science and engineering practices in the
standards highlights the need to coordinate STE experiences over time (also see Appendix VII). Students
should learn the fundamental concepts of each domain of STE, as well as the connections across those
domains.
A school district or educator can choose from many instructional models and curricular design
approaches to effectively engage students in STE learning. One option (among these many) is Project-
Based Learning (PBL), in which students go through an extended process of inquiry or design in response
to an authentic question, problem, or challenge. They draw from many disciplines when understanding
and addressing a complex problem. PBL is centered on student and teacher collaboration and
application of academic knowledge and skills. While engaged in PBL, students are engaged in science
and engineering practices, as well as cross-disciplinary concepts; students engage in reading and writing
informational text and mathematics depending on the driving question of the project. A PBL approach
allows for some student choice and voice that promotes motivation and educational equity. PBL
includes a process of revision and reflection that requires students to learn how to communicate and
receive instructive feedback and to think about their own cognition and understanding.
The amount of time individual students need to achieve STE standards will vary. The chart below
provides the time assumed to be provided for STE instruction by grade span to inform the standards
development:
                                   Grade       Assumed Minutes per Day
                                   Span             (Hours per week)
                                   K–2      25 minutes/day (~2 hours/week)
                                   3–5      35 minutes/day (~3 hours/week)
                                   6–8      55 minutes/day (~4.5 hours/week)
                                   9–12     65 minutes/day (~5.5 hours/week)
Schools may take more or less time, depending on local factors that determine curriculum programming
within a specific context. STE instruction may be a dedicated time in the school schedule or may be
integrated with instruction of other subjects. The goal is for all students to have regular STE instruction
every year.

Guiding Principle 9
(Coherence)
An effective science and technology/engineering program requires
coherent districtwide planning and ongoing support for implementation.
An effective curriculum that addresses the learning standards of this Framework must be planned as a
cohesive pre-K–12 program. Teachers in different classrooms and at different levels should agree about
what is to be taught in given grades. For example, middle school teachers should be able to expect that
students coming from different elementary schools within a district share a common set of STE
understandings and skills, and that the students they send on to high school will be well prepared for
what comes next. In order for this expectation to be met, middle school teachers need to plan curricula
in coordination with their elementary and high school colleagues and with district staff.
To facilitate planning, a district coordinator or administrator should be involved in articulating,
coordinating, and implementing a districtwide (pre-K–12) STE curriculum. School districts should choose
engaging, challenging, and accurate curriculum materials that are based on research into how children
learn STE, as well as research about how to address student preconceptions.
When planning for the introduction of a new curriculum, it is important to explicitly identify how success
will be measured. Indicators need to be determined and should be communicated to all stakeholders.
Supervisors should monitor whether the curriculum is actually being used, how instruction has changed,
and how student learning is being realized. Teacher teams, working across grade levels, should look at
student work and other forms of assessment to determine whether there is evidence of achievement of
the sought-for gains in student understanding.
Implementation of a new curriculum is accomplished over multiple years and requires opportunities for
extensive professional development. Teachers must have both content knowledge and pedagogical
expertise to use curricular materials in a way that enhances student learning. A well-planned program
for professional development provides for both content learning and content-based pedagogical
training. It is further recommended that middle and high school courses be taught by teachers who are
certified in their areas and who are, therefore, very familiar with the safe use of materials, equipment,
and processes.
Finally, students will be more likely to succeed in meeting the standards if they have the curricular and
instructional support that encourages their interests in STE. Further, students who are motivated to
continue their studies and to persist in more advanced and challenging courses are more likely to
become STEM-engaged citizens and, in some cases, pursue careers in STEM fields. These affective goals
should be an explicit focus of quality STE programs.

Science and Technology/Engineering
Learning Standards
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering 23


Overview of the Standards
The Massachusetts standards are an adaptation of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) based
on the Framework for K–12 Science Education (NRC, 2012). This is done so educators and districts can
benefit from commonality across states, including use of NGSS-aligned resources created elsewhere.
Common features include:
     •   Integration of science and engineering practices.
     •   Grade-by-grade standards for elementary school that include all STE disciplines.
     •   Application of science in engineering contexts.
While the Massachusetts STE standards have much in common with NGSS, public input from across the
Commonwealth during the development of the standards identified several needed adaptations for
Massachusetts:
     •   Include technology/engineering as a discipline equivalent to traditional sciences.
     •   Include only two dimensions (disciplinary core ideas and science and engineering practices) in
         the standards, while encouraging the inclusion of crosscutting concepts and the nature of
         science in the curriculum.
     •   Balance broad concepts with specificity to inform consistent interpretation.
     •   Maintain the Massachusetts model of introductory high school course options.
Structural Features of the Standards
The STE standards are presented using a consistent structure:
The pre-K–8 standards are presented by grade, with each grade focused on a grade-level theme that
links the standards and all four STE disciplines (see Appendix V). High school standards are provided for
five common introductory-level courses. Standards are organized by disciplinary core ideas, consistently
referenced throughout the grades. For standards that are not aligned to NGSS (i.e., standards added by
Massachusetts) an “(MA)” has been added to the label. Asterisks (*) designate standards that have an
engineering design application.
Labeling/Coding of the Standards
The Massachusetts STE standards are labeled using the NGSS system, as shown here:
The first component of each label indicates the grade (pre-K to grade 8) and/or span (middle or high
school). The next component specifies the discipline and core idea. Finally, the number at the end of
each label indicates the particular standard within the related set.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering                           24


Maintaining the labeling system from NGSS is intended to allow Massachusetts’ educators access to
curriculum and instruction resources developed across the country. This occasionally results in
standards that appear to be out of sequence or skip a number (because some NGSS standards are not
included in the Massachusetts standards), but the benefits of consistency with NGSS outweigh those of
renumbering. Note that the order in which the standards are listed does not imply or define an intended
instructional sequence.
Components of the Standards
Many standards include clarification statements (which supply examples or additional clarification to the
standards) and state assessment boundary statements (which are meant to specify limits to state
assessment). Note that these are not intended to limit or constrain curriculum or classroom instruction:
educators are welcome to teach and assess additional concepts, practices, and vocabulary that are not
included in the standards.
Relationship of Standards to Curriculum and Instruction
The standards are outcomes, or goals, that reflect what a student should know and be able to do. They
do not dictate a manner or methods of teaching. The standards are written in a way that expresses the
concept and skills to be achieved and demonstrated by students, but leaves curricular and instructional
decisions to districts, schools, and teachers. The standards are not a set of instructional activities or
assessment tasks. They are statements of what students should be able to do as a result of instruction.
In particular, it is important to note that the scientific and engineering practices are not teaching
strategies—they are important learning goals in their own right; they are skills to be learned as a result
of instruction. As the standards are performances meant to be accomplished at the conclusion of
instruction, quality instruction should engage students in multiple practices throughout instruction.
Students cannot comprehend scientific practices, or fully appreciate the nature of scientific knowledge
itself, without learning the science and engineering practices. This Framework uses the term “practices”
instead of terms such as “inquiry” or “skills” to emphasize that the practices are outcomes to be
learned, not a method of instruction.
It is also important to note that the standards identify the most essential material for students to know
and do. They are not an exhaustive list of all that could be included in a student’s science education;
students should not be prevented from going beyond them where appropriate. Teachers have the
flexibility to arrange the standards in any order within a grade level and add areas of study to suit the
needs of their students and science programs. Including various applications of science, such as
biotechnology, clean energy, medicine, forensics, agriculture, or robotics, would nicely facilitate student
interest and demonstrate how the standards are applied in real-world contexts (see Appendix IX).

Use of Selected Terms
This section clarifies the intended use of certain terms in the standards.
Engineering Design
Design problem: An articulation of a problem to be solved or a thing to be improved that addresses a
personal, communal, or societal need. Engaging in or addressing a design problem results in a product (a
physical thing or a process).
Scale
Local: Describes an area relevant to what is being studied, generally a local community or small region
(e.g., an area of a state). Does not have to be near where the student lives, although that can be the
area under study. A local area can also be, for example, a place in Costa Rica if the topic of study is a rain
forest, or a place in the Arctic if that is being studied.
Regional: Generally refers to a statewide or multistate perspective relative to what is being studied or, if
on another continent, approximately a country or small set of countries that constitute a regional scope.
Material Properties
Different properties of materials are specified and used throughout the standards. The table below
shows the grade span at which each property is introduced. Once introduced at one grade level, the
property may be used, referred to, or expected in any later grade. A check mark () indicates that the
property is specified again in the later grade span.

                                                          See Appendix I for additional information
Pre-K through grade 2 standards integrate all eight
science and engineering practices. Pre-K standards
ask students to demonstrate an ability to ask questions, set up simple investigations, analyze evidence,
observations, and data for patterns, and use evidence to explain or develop ideas about how
phenomena work. Kindergarten standards call for students to show further development of
investigation and communication skills, as well as application of science concepts to designing solutions
to problems, and to now use information obtained from text and media sources. Grade 1 standards call
for students to continue developing investigation skills, including their ability to pose scientific questions
as well as their ability to analyze observations and data and to effectively use informational sources.
Grade 1 standards also call for students to demonstrate their ability to craft scientific explanations using
evidence from a variety of sources. Grade 2 standards call for students to use models in a scientific
context and further their skills in a number of the practices, including investigations, data analysis,
designing solutions, argumentation, and use of informational sources.
Some examples of specific skills students should develop in these grades:
     1. Raise questions about how different types of environments provide homes for living things; ask
          and/or identify questions that can be answered by an investigation.
     2. Use a model to compare how plants and animals depend on their surroundings; develop and/or
          use a model to represent amounts, relationships, and/or patterns in the natural world;
          distinguish between a model and the actual object and/or process the model represents.
     3. Conduct an investigation of light and shadows; plan and conduct an investigation collaboratively
          to produce data to answer a question; make observations and/or relative measurements to
          collect data that can be used to make comparisons.
     4. Analyze data to identify relationships among seasonal patterns of change; use observations to
          describe patterns and/or relationships in the natural world and to answer scientific questions.
     5. Decide when to use qualitative vs. quantitative information; use counting and numbers to
          describe patterns in the natural world.
     6. Use information from observations to construct an evidence-based account of nature.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering                               27


     7. Construct an argument with evidence for how plants and animals can change the
         environment; distinguish between opinions and evidence in one’s own explanations; listen
         actively to others to indicate agreement or disagreement based on evidence.
     8. Obtain information to compare ways that parents and their offspring behave to survive; obtain
         information using various texts, text features, or other media to answer a question.
While presented as distinct skill sets, the eight practices intentionally overlap and interconnect. Skills
such as those outlined above should be reflected in curricula and instruction that engage students in an
integrated use of the practices. See the Science and Engineering Practices Progression Matrix (Appendix
I) for more information, including particular skills for students in grades pre-K–2.

Pre-Kindergarten
The World Around Me
Pre-K students focus on experiencing and making observations of the world around them. They are
beginning to learn about their own environment as they observe plants and animals, the Moon and the
Sun, and the daily weather. They experience their world through their senses and body parts and begin
to recognize that animals also use their senses and body parts to meet their basic needs. They
investigate pitch and volume, shadow and light, liquids and solids, and how things move. They sort
materials by simple observable properties such as texture and color. They share their understanding of
these concepts through discussion as they develop their language and quantitative skills. Pre-K students
build awareness of the wide variety of natural phenomena and processes in the world around them.

Kindergarten
Reasons for Change
In kindergarten, students build on early experiences observing the world around them as they continue
to make observations that are more quantitative in nature and help them identify why some changes
occur. Students begin to learn to use these observations as evidence to support a claim through growing
language skills. They learn that all animals and plants need food, water, and air to grow and thrive and
that the fundamental difference between plants and animals is a plant’s ability to make its own food.
Students build their quantitative knowledge of temperature in relation to the weather and its effect on
different kinds of materials. They observe that the amount of sunlight shining on a surface causes a
temperature change and they design a structure to reduce the warming effects of sunlight. They
investigate motions of objects by changing the strength and direction of pushes and pulls. They provide
examples of plants and animals that can change their environment through their interactions with it. In
kindergarten science, students begin to identify reasons for changes in some common phenomena.

Grade 1
Describing Patterns
In grade 1, students have more fluency with language, number sense, and inquiry skills. This allows them
to describe patterns of motion between the Sun, Moon, and stars in relation to the Earth. From this
understanding they can identify seasonal patterns from sunrise and sunset data that will allow them to
predict future patterns. Building from their experiences in pre-K and kindergarten observing and
describing daily weather, they can now examine seasonal data on temperature and rainfall to describe
patterns over time. Grade 1 students investigate sound and light through various materials. They
describe patterns in how light passes through and sounds differ from different types of materials and
use this to design and build a device to send a signal. Students compare the ways different animals and
plants use their body parts and senses to do the things they need to do to grow and survive, including
typical ways parents keep their young safe so they will survive to adulthood. They notice that though
there are differences between plants or animals of the same type, the similarities of behavior and
appearance are what allow us to identify them as belonging to a group. Grade 1 students begin to
understand the power of patterns to predict future events in the natural and designed world.

Grade 2
Wholes and Parts
As students grow in their ability to speak, read, write, and reason mathematically, they also grow in their
ability to grapple with larger systems and the parts that make them up. In grade 2, students start to look
beyond the structures of individual plants and animals to looking at the environment in which the plants
and animals live as a provider of the food, water, and shelter that the organisms need. They learn that
water is found everywhere on Earth and takes different forms and shapes. They map landforms and
bodies of water and observe that flowing water and wind shapes these landforms. Grade 2 students use
their observation skills gained in earlier grades to classify materials based on similar properties and
functions. They gain experience testing different materials to collect and then analyze data for the
purpose of determining which materials are the best for a specific function. They construct large objects
from smaller pieces and, conversely, learn that when materials are cut into the smallest possible pieces,
they still exist as the same material that has weight. These investigations of how parts relate to the
whole provide a key basis for understanding systems in later grades.

through a well-rounded curriculum.                            See Appendix I for additional information
Standards for grades 3 through 5 integrate all eight science and engineering practices. Some examples of
specific skills students should develop in these grades include:

         distinguish between scientific (testable) and non-scientific (non-testable) questions; define a
         simple design problem, including criteria for success and constraints on materials or time.
      2. Use graphical representations to show differences in organisms’ life cycles; develop a model of a
         wave to communicate wave features; use a particulate model of matter to explain phase
         changes; identify limitations of models; use a model to test cause and effect relationships.
      3. Conduct an investigation to determine the nature of forces between magnets; make
         observations and collect data about the effects of mechanical weathering; conduct an
         experiment on mixing of substances; evaluate appropriate methods for collecting data; make
         predictions about what would happen if a variable changes.
      4. Use graphs and tables of weather data to describe and predict typical weather during a season;
         analyze and interpret maps of Earth’s physical features; use data to evaluate and refine design
         solutions.
      5. Graph and describe the amounts and percentages of fresh and salt water in various reservoirs;
         measure and graph weights of substances before and after a chemical reaction.
      6. Use evidence to explain how variations among individuals can provide advantages in survival
         and reproduction; provide evidence to explain the effect of multiple forces on the motion of an
         object; test and refine a simple system designed to filter impurities out of water.
      7. Construct an argument that animals and plants have internal and external structures that
         support their survival, growth, behavior, and reproduction; distinguish among facts, reasoned
         judgment based on data, and speculation in an argument.
      8. Obtain and summarize information about the climate of different regions; gather information on
         possible solutions to a given design problem; obtain information about renewable and
         nonrenewable energy sources.

Grade 3
Human Interactions
In grade 3, students develop and sharpen their skills at obtaining, recording and charting, and analyzing
data in order to study their environment. They use these practices to study the interactions between
humans and earth systems, humans and the environment, and humans and the designed world. They
learn that these entities not only interact but influence behaviors, reactions, and traits of organisms.
Grade 3 students analyze weather patterns and consider humans’ influence and opportunity to impact
weather-related events. In life science they study the interactions between and influence of the
environment and human traits and characteristics. They use the engineering design process to identify a
problem and design solutions that enhance humans’ interactions with their surroundings and to meet
their needs. Students consider the interactions and consequent reactions between objects and forces,
including forces that are balanced or not. Students reason and provide evidence to support arguments
for the influence of humans on nature and nature on human experience.

Connections and Relationships in Systems
In grade 5, students model, provide evidence to support arguments, and obtain and display data about
relationships and interactions among observable components of different systems. By studying systems,
grade 5 students learn that objects and organisms do not exist in isolation and that animals, plants and
their environments are connected to, interact with, and are influenced by each other. They study the
relationships between Earth and other nearby objects in the solar system and the impact of those
relationships on patterns of events as seen from Earth. They learn about the relationship among
elements of Earth’s systems through the cycling of water and human practices and processes with
Earth’s resources. They also learn about the connections and relationships among plants and animals,
and the ecosystems within which they live, to show how matter and energy are cycled through these

be engaged in through a well-rounded curriculum.            See Appendix I for additional information
Standards for grades 6 through 8 integrate all eight
science and engineering practices. Students’ understanding of and ability with each practice gets more
detailed and sophisticated through middle school. For example, by the end of middle school, students
can identify limitations of a particular model, including limitations of its accuracy, what features are
included (or not), and limitations of what phenomena or outcomes it can predict. Students can develop
models of varying levels of detail and accuracy and can identify when a situation calls for a conceptual
model with little detail or a specific model with attention to accuracy, such as for making predictions of
particular events.
Some examples of specific skills students should develop in these grades:
     1. Define criteria and constraints of a design problem with precision.
     2. Develop a model to describe cycling of matter in an ecosystem; develop a model that describes
         and predicts changes in particle motion and spatial arrangement during phase changes; develop
         and/or revise a model to show the relationships among variables, including those that are not
         observable but predict observable phenomena.
     3. Conduct an investigation to show relationships among energy transfer, type of matter, and
         kinetic energy of particles; conduct an experiment to show that many materials are mixtures.
     4. Examine and interpret data to describe the role human activities have played in the rise of
         global temperatures over time; construct, analyze, and/or interpret graphical displays of data
         and/or large data sets to identify linear and nonlinear relationships; distinguish between causal
         and correlational relationships in data; consider limitations of data analysis.
     5. Describe, including through probability statements and proportional reasoning, the process of
         natural selection; use data and graphs to describe relationships among kinetic energy, mass, and
         speed of an object.
     6. Construct an explanation using evidence for how Earth’s surface has changed over time; apply
         scientific reasoning to show why the data or evidence is adequate for the explanation.

     7. Construct an argument based on evidence for how environmental and genetic factors influence
         organism growth; respectfully provide and receive critiques about one’s arguments, procedures,
         and models by citing relevant evidence with pertinent detail.
     8. Synthesize and communicate information about artificial selection; obtain and communicate
         information on how past geologic events are analyzed to make future predictions.
While presented as distinct skill sets, the eight practices intentionally overlap and interconnect. Skills
such as those outlined above should be reflected in curricula and instruction that engage students in an
integrated use of the practices. See the Science and Engineering Practices Progression Matrix (Appendix
I) for more information, including particular skills for students in grades 6–8.

and function through analyzing the macro- and microscopic world, such as Earth features and processes,
the role of cells and anatomy in supporting living organisms, and properties of materials and waves.
Students use models and provide evidence to make claims and explanations about structure-function
relationships in different STE domains.

Grade 7
Systems and Cycles
Students in grade 7 focus on systems and cycles using their understanding of structures and functions,
connections and relationships in systems, and flow of matter and energy developed in earlier grades. A
focus on systems requires students to apply concepts and skills across disciplines, since most natural and
designed systems and cycles are complex and interactive. They gain experience with plate tectonics,
interactions of humans and Earth processes, organism systems to support and propagate life, ecosystem
dynamics, motion and energy systems, and key technological systems used by society. Through grade 7,
students begin a process of moving from a more concrete to an abstract perspective, since many of the
systems and cycles studied are not directly observable or experienced. This also creates a foundation for
exploring cause and effect relationships in more depth in grade 8.

Grade 8
Cause and Effect
Grade 8 students use more robust abstract thinking skills to explain causes of complex phenomena and
systems. Many causes are not immediately or physically visible to students. An understanding of cause
and effect of key natural phenomena and designed processes allows students to explain patterns and
make predictions about future events. In grade 8 these include, for example, causes of seasons and
tides; causes of plate tectonics and weather or climate; the role of genetics in reproduction, heredity,
and artificial selection; and how atoms and molecules interact to explain the substances that make up
the world and how materials change. Being able to analyze phenomena for evidence of causes and
processes that often cannot be seen, and being able to conceptualize and describe those, is a significant
outcome for grade 8 students.

relevant issues in science to be informed decision-                    and designing solutions (for
makers. Accurately using mathematics and                               engineering)
computation as it applies to daily life and engaging               7. Engaging in an argument from evidence
in the practice of modeling to solve real-world                    8. Obtaining, evaluating, and
problems enables all students to understand and                        communicating information
analyze key scientific and technical issues they will         See Appendix I for additional information
be asked to address throughout their lives.
Communicating explanations coherently, with
evidence from credible sources, is critical to engaging in public discourse.
Inclusion of science and engineering practices in standards only speak to the types of performances
students should be able to demonstrate at the end of instruction of a particular course; the standards do
not limit what educators and students should or can be engaged in through a well-rounded curriculum.
By the end of high school, students should have an understanding of and ability to apply each science
and engineering practice to understand the world around them. Students should have had many
opportunities to immerse themselves in the practices and to explore why they are central to the
applications of science and engineering.
Some examples of these science and engineering practices include:
     1. Define a design problem that involves the development of a process or system with interacting
         components and criteria and constraints that may include social, technical, and/or
         environmental considerations.
     2. Develop and/or use a model (including mathematical and computational) to generate data to
         support explanations, predict phenomena, analyze systems, and/or solve problems.
     3. Plan and conduct an investigation, including deciding on the types, amount, and accuracy of
         data needed to produce reliable measurements, and consider limitations on the precision of the
         data.
     4. Apply concepts of statistics and probability (including determining function fits to data, slope,
         intercept, and correlation coefficient for linear fits) to scientific questions and engineering
         problems, using digital tools when feasible.
     5. Use simple limit cases to test mathematical expressions, computer programs, algorithms, or
         simulations of a process or system to see if a model “makes sense” by comparing the outcomes
         with what is known about the real world.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering                                72


     6. Apply scientific reasoning, theory, and/or models to link evidence to the claims and assess the
         extent to which the reasoning and data support the explanation or conclusion.
     7. Respectfully provide and/or receive critiques on scientific arguments by probing reasoning and
         evidence and challenging ideas and conclusions, and determining what additional information is
         required to solve contradictions.
     8. Evaluate the validity and reliability of and/or synthesize multiple claims, methods, and/or
         designs that appear in scientific and technical texts or media, verifying the data when possible.
While presented as distinct skill sets, the eight practices intentionally overlap and interconnect. Skills
like those outlined above should be reflected in curriculum and instruction that engage students in an
integrated use of the practices. The introductory courses (grades 9–10) integrate practices into the
standards. In upper-level high school courses (grades 11–12), students should be given continued
opportunities to develop the practices. See the Science and Engineering Practices Progression Matrix
(Appendix I) for more information, including particular skills for students in high school.

High School Earth and Space Science
The high school Earth and space science standards build from middle school and allow grade 9 or 10
students to explain additional and more complex phenomena related to Earth processes and systems,
interactions among Earth’s systems, and interactions of Earth’s systems and human actions. The
standards expect students to apply a variety of science and engineering practices to three core ideas of
earth and space science:
The standards about Earth’s place in the universe help students understand the universe and its stars,
Earth and the solar system, and the history of planet Earth. Students examine the processes governing
the formation, evolution, and workings of the solar system and universe.
Earth’s systems standards help students explain phenomena related to Earth materials and systems,
plate tectonics and large-scale system interactions, the roles of water in Earth’s surface processes, and
weather and climate. Students develop models and explanations for the ways that feedbacks between
different Earth systems control the appearance of Earth’s surface. Central to this is the tension between
internal systems, which are largely responsible for creating land at Earth’s surface, and the Sun-driven
surface systems that tear down the land through weathering and erosion. Students begin to examine
the ways that human activities cause feedbacks that create changes to other systems. Students
understand the system interactions that control weather and climate, with a major emphasis on the
mechanisms and implications of climate change. Students model the flow of energy between different
components of the weather system and chemical cycles such as the carbon cycle.
Standards about Earth and human activity help students understand natural resources, natural hazards,
human impact on Earth systems, and global climate change. Students understand the complex and
significant interdependencies between humans and the rest of Earth’s systems through the impacts of
natural hazards, our dependencies on natural resources, and the significant environmental impacts of
human activities. Students apply engineering design and the analysis of geoscience data to examine
solutions to challenges facing long-term human sustainability on Earth.
Across the high school Earth and space science standards, particular emphasis is placed on science and
engineering practices of developing and using models; constructing explanations; and obtaining,
evaluating, and communicating information. For example, students are expected to be able to use
models to describe and predict the relationships between Earth’s systems and analyze data to support
explanations of Earth processes. They must be able to construct and revise explanations based on valid,
reliable, and relevant evidence and apply scientific reasoning to evaluate complex environmental
problems such as the relationship between management of natural resources and sustainability or
biodiversity. Students are expected to compare, synthesize, evaluate, and communicate information
sources about various Earth systems, interactions between Earth and human activity, and the workings
of the solar system. The application of these practices across the core ideas gives students a rich
grounding in Earth and space science.

their life cycle, produce elements from helium to iron and release energy that eventually reaches Earth
in the form of radiation.
     State Assessment Boundary:
          •   Specific stages of the life of a star, details of the many different nucleosynthesis pathways

              assessment.
HS-ESS1-2. Describe the astronomical evidence for the Big Bang theory, including the red shift of light
from the motion of distant galaxies as an indication that the universe is currently expanding, the cosmic
microwave background as the remnant radiation from the Big Bang, and the observed composition of
ordinary matter of the universe, primarily found in stars and interstellar gases, which matches that
predicted by the Big Bang theory (3/4 hydrogen and 1/4 helium).
HS-ESS1-4. Use Kepler’s laws to predict the motion of orbiting objects in the solar system. Describe how
orbits may change due to the gravitational effects from, or collisions with, other objects in the solar
system.
     Clarification Statements:
          •   Kepler’s laws apply to human-made satellites as well as planets, moons, and other objects.
          •   Calculations involving Kepler’s laws of orbital motions should not deal with more than two
              bodies, nor involve calculus.
HS-ESS1-5. Evaluate evidence of the past and current movements of continental and oceanic crust, the
theory of plate tectonics, and relative densities of oceanic and continental rocks to explain why
continental rocks are generally much older than rocks of the ocean floor.
     Clarification Statement:
          •   Examples include the ages of oceanic crust (less than 200 million years old) increasing with
              distance from mid-ocean ridges (a result of plate spreading at divergent boundaries) and the
              ages of North American continental crust (which can be older than 4 billion years) increasing
              with distance away from a central ancient core (a result of past plate interactions at
              convergent boundaries).

     Clarification Statement:
          •   Examples can include how decreasing the amount of glacial ice reduces the amount of
              sunlight reflected from Earth’s surface, increasing surface temperatures and further
              reducing the amount of ice; how the loss of ground vegetation causes an increase in water
              runoff and soil erosion; how dammed rivers increase groundwater recharge, decrease
              sediment transport, and increase coastal erosion; and how the loss of wetlands causes a
              decrease in local humidity that further reduces the wetland extent.

             seismic waves, records of the rate of change of Earth’s magnetic field (as constraints on
             convection in the outer core), and identification of the composition of Earth’s layers from
             high-pressure laboratory experiments.
HS-ESS2-4. Use a model to describe how variations in the flow of energy into and out of Earth’s systems
over different time scales result in changes in climate. Analyze and interpret data to explain that long-
term changes in Earth’s tilt and orbit result in cycles of climate change such as Ice Ages.
    Clarification Statement:
         •   Examples of the causes of climate change differ by timescale: large volcanic eruption and
             ocean circulation over 1–10 years; changes in human activity, ocean circulation, and solar
             output over tens to hundreds of years; changes to Earth’s orbit and the orientation of its
             axis over tens to hundreds of thousands of years; and long-term changes in atmospheric
             composition over tens to hundreds of millions of years.

             patterns, glacial ice volumes, sea levels, and biosphere distribution in state assessment.
HS-ESS2-5. Describe how the chemical and physical properties of water are important in mechanical and
chemical mechanisms that affect Earth materials and surface processes.
    Clarification Statements:

             expansion of water as it freezes.
         •   Examples of chemical mechanisms involving water include chemical weathering and
             recrystallization (based on solubility of different materials) and melt generation (based on

High School Biology
The high school biology standards build from middle school and allow grade 9 or 10 students to explain
additional and more complex phenomena related to genetics, the functioning of organisms, and
interrelationships between organisms, populations, and the environment. The standards expect
students to apply a variety of science and engineering practices to four core ideas of biology:
From molecules to organisms: structures and processes standards help students formulate an answer
to the question, “How do organisms live and grow?” Students demonstrate that they can use
investigations and gather evidence to support explanations of cell function and reproduction. They
understand the role of proteins as essential to the work of the cell and living systems. Students can use
models to explain photosynthesis, respiration, and the cycling of matter and flow of energy in living
organisms. The cellular processes can be used as a model for understanding the hierarchical
organization of organisms.
Standards focused on ecosystems: interactions, energy, and dynamics help students formulate an
answer to the question, “How and why do organisms interact with their environment, and what are the
effects of these interactions?” Students can use mathematical reasoning to demonstrate understanding
of fundamental concepts of carrying capacity, factors affecting biodiversity and populations, and the
cycling of matter and flow of energy among organisms in an ecosystem. These models support students’
conceptual understanding of systems and their ability to develop design solutions to reduce the impact
of human activities on the environment and maintain biodiversity.
Heredity: inheritance and variation of traits standards help students formulate answers to the
questions: “How are characteristics of one generation passed to the next? How can individuals of the
same species and even siblings have different characteristics?” Students are able to ask questions, make
and defend a claim, and use concepts of probability to explain the genetic variation in a population.
Students demonstrate understanding of why individuals of the same species vary in how they look and
function. Students can explain the mechanisms of genetic inheritance and describe the environmental
and genetic causes of gene mutation and the alteration of gene expression.
Standards for biological evolution: unity and diversity help students formulate an answer to the
question, “What evidence shows that different species are related?” Students construct explanations for
the processes of natural selection and evolution and communicate how multiple lines of evidence
support these explanations. Students can evaluate evidence of the conditions that may result in new
species and understand the role of genetic variation in natural selection. Additionally, students can
apply concepts of probability to explain trends in populations as those trends relate to advantageous
heritable traits in a specific environment.
The high school biology standards place particular emphasis on science and engineering practices of
developing and using models; constructing explanations; engaging in argumentation from evidence; and
obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. Students are expected to use multiple types of
models, including mathematical models, to make predictions and develop explanations, analyze and
identify flaws in the model, and communicate ideas that accurately represent or simulate the biological
system. Students are asked to construct and revise explanations and claims based on valid and reliable
evidence and apply scientific reasoning to evaluate complex real-world problems such as the effects of
human activity on biodiversity and ecosystem health. Students must be able to find and interpret
scientific literature to compare, integrate, and evaluate sources and communicate phenomena related
to genetics, the functioning of organisms, and interrelationships between organisms, populations, and
the environment. The application of these practices across the core ideas gives students a rich
grounding in biology.

High School Chemistry
The high school chemistry standards build from middle school physical sciences standards. Middle
school includes an important transition from macroscopic phenomena to molecular level models that
are used to explain and predict energy transformations in phase changes and conservation of matter in
chemical changes, including the use of a basic particle model to visualize and represent physical changes
of matter. In high school, students consider how structure and composition at sub-atomic scales explain
structure-property relationships in chemistry and influence energy transformations and dissipation of
energy during chemical and physical changes.
As a discipline that is concerned not only with what we can know but also with what we can do with
what we know, chemistry emphasizes science and engineering practices related to design and
evaluation as well as investigation and modeling. For example, students are challenged to apply
chemistry knowledge to designing ways to control the extent of chemical reactions for practical
purposes, analyze unknown samples to determine identities and concentrations of possible pollutants,
and evaluate the consequences of using different materials for household items. Students are expected
to apply mathematical reasoning when considering conservation of matter in chemical reactions and in
comparing strength of acid-base solutions. Students apply a variety of science and engineering practices
to three disciplinary core ideas of chemistry:
The major focus of chemistry is on matter and its interactions. Students develop both molecular and
sub-atomic models of matter and learn to rely on the periodic table as a powerful model for predicting a
wide variety of properties of elements and compounds. Students develop greater capacity for building
multi-step linear causal explanations by using a combination of the periodic table model and Coulomb’s
law to predict and explain qualitative comparisons of bond energies. They also consider spatial
arrangements of ions in crystal structures and covalent bonds in molecules, and the relative favorability
of energy changes required to rearrange components. Students reason about timescales in the context
of a collision theory model, and consider how altering external conditions, chemical concentrations, and
ways of introducing reactants to a system can be manipulated to control chemical processes. Students
refine their understanding of conservation of matter by making quantitative predictions of theoretical
yields if reactions are driven to completion using stoichiometric molar proportions and molar mass
calculations. They also practice using two major models of reaction processes, the Bronsted-Lowry acid-
base reaction model and the oxidation-reduction reaction model, to explain reaction patterns observed
in many common phenomena in the natural world.
Standards for motion and stability: forces and interactions help students explain structure-property
relationships in terms of forces and interactions, and to consider the energetic stabilities of structures as
a driving force in predicting a variety of observable response properties. Water’s role as a common
solvent is a central example in using molecular-level intermolecular bonding structure arguments to
explain the relative solubilities of different ionic compounds. Intermolecular bonding is also explored in
rationalizing why some classes of substances are better than others for specific practical uses, and
designing molecular level structural specifications of substances that could have desired properties.
Students also build on the basic particle model of matter studied in middle school to add quantitative
predictions of externally controllable or measurable properties of gases.
Standards about energy help students demonstrate understanding of energy transfer and dissipation of
energy in chemical systems. Students rationalize observations of endothermic and exothermic changes
in terms of energy required to break and form chemical bonds when structural rearrangements occur in
chemical processes.

High School Introductory Physics
The high school introductory physics standards build from middle school and allow grade 9 or 10
students to explain additional and more complex phenomena central to the physical world. The
standards expect students to apply a variety of science and engineering practices to three core ideas of
physics:
Standards on motion and stability: forces and interactions support students’ understanding of ideas
related to why some objects move in certain ways, why objects change their motion, and why some
materials are attracted to each other while others are not. This core idea helps students answer the
question, “How can one explain and predict interactions between objects and within systems of
objects?” Students are able to demonstrate their understanding by applying scientific and engineering
ideas related to Newton’s second law, total momentum, conservation, system analysis, and gravitational
and electrostatic forces.
A focus on energy develops students’ understanding of energy at both the macroscopic and atomic
scales that can be accounted for as either motions of particles or energy stored in fields. This core idea
helps students answer the question, “How is energy transferred and conserved?” Energy is understood
as a quantitative property of a system that depends on the motion and interactions of matter and
radiation within that system; the total change of energy in any system is always equal to the total energy
transferred into or out of the system. Students apply their understanding to explain situations that
involve conservation of energy, energy transfer, and tracing the relationship between energy and forces.
Standards on waves and their applications in technologies for information transfer support students’
understanding of the physical principles used in a wide variety of existing and emerging technologies. As
such, this core idea helps students answer the question, “How are waves used to transfer energy and
send and store information?” Students are able to apply understanding of how wave properties and the
interactions of electromagnetic radiation with matter can transfer information across long distances,
store information, and investigate nature on many scales. They develop and use models of
electromagnetic radiation, as either a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields or as particles.
Students understand that combining waves of different frequencies can make a wide variety of patterns
and thereby encode and transmit information. They can demonstrate their understanding by explaining
how the principles of wave behavior and wave interactions with matter are used in technological
devices to transmit and capture information and energy.
Across the set of high school introductory physics standards, particular emphasis is placed on science
and engineering practices of developing and using models, analyzing and interpreting data, using
mathematics, and engaging in argument from evidence. Students are expected to use mathematical and
graphical representations and models to quantitatively and qualitatively describe, evaluate, and make
predictions of a variety of phenomena such as motion, energy, and waves. Students should be able to
use multiple types of models and compare their merits and limitations and level of detail and accuracy,
and use them as a basis for explanations or arguments about underlying concepts or processes. The
standards call for students to critique competing ideas and evaluate design solutions using data and
evidence relevant to high school science. Analyzing and interpreting data gathered during investigations
or experiments, such as of magnetic fields and electric current, wave properties, or motion, also
contributes to students’ development of explanations and arguments using relevant, quantitative
evidence. Applying these practices across the core ideas gives students a rich grounding in introductory
physics.

High School Technology/Engineering
The high school technology/engineering standards build from middle school and allow grade 9 or 10
students to explain major technological systems used in society and to engage in more sophisticated
design problems. The standards expect students to apply a variety of science and engineering practices
to four core ideas of technology/engineering:
     •  Engineering design standards support students’ understanding of how engineering design is
        applied to complex societal challenges as well as developing their skills in defining design
        problems and developing solutions.
     •  A focus on materials, tools, and manufacturing supports students in understanding how
        manufacturing makes use of and can change material properties to create useful products. They
        consider different manufacturing processes, including where computer-aided systems can be
        useful, and how those processes can affect material properties.
     •  Standards about technological systems help students to learn how complex design systems work,
        particularly those they use every day. Such systems include communications systems, structural
        systems, and transportation systems. Through the study of these critical infrastructure systems,
        students understand how the components they interact with every day depend on the design and
        functioning of the larger system. They also can abstract the concept of a system, identifying inputs
        and outputs of subsystems and their interrelationships.
     •  Energy and power technologies standards support students in understanding how humans
        manipulate and use energy to accomplish physical tasks that would otherwise be impossible or
        difficult. These technologies include open and closed pneumatic and hydraulic systems.
The high school technology/engineering standards place particular emphasis on science and
engineering practices of developing and using models; analyzing and interpreting data; using
mathematics; designing solutions; and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. Relevant
examples give students a valuable context to learn about and model a technological system, use a
model to explain differences in systems or illustrate how a system works. This leads to a more detailed
understanding of the role that engineering design, materials, tools, and manufacturing have in the
natural and designed world. The standards expect students to research and analyze specific design
solutions that give them an opportunity to determine optimal conditions for performance of materials,
influences of cost, constraints, criteria, and possible environmental impacts. Use of mathematics is a key
skill in designing prototypes to scale, using prototypes or simulations that model multiple interactions in
a complex problem and calculating change to a system that includes a number of variables. Students
communicate and evaluate solutions to real-world problems, propose or refine solutions, and examine
the social and cultural impacts a product, material, manufacturing process, or technology could have in
our world. The application of these practices across the core ideas gives students a rich grounding in
technology/engineering.

Appendix I
Science and Engineering Practices Progression Matrix
The Science and Engineering Practices
Science and engineering practices include the skills necessary to engage in scientific inquiry and
engineering design. It is necessary to teach these so students develop an understanding and facility with
the practices in appropriate contexts. The Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012) identifies
eight essential science and engineering practices:
     1.   Asking questions (for science) and defining problems (for engineering).
     2.   Developing and using models.
     3.   Planning and carrying out investigations.
     4.   Analyzing and interpreting data.
     5.   Using mathematics and computational thinking.
     6.   Constructing explanations (for science) and designing solutions (for engineering).
     7.   Engaging in argument from evidence.
     8.   Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information.
The field of science education refers to these as “practices” rather than “science processes” or “inquiry
skills” for several reasons. First, skills are not separate from concepts:
     We use the term “practices” instead of a term such as “skills” to emphasize that engaging in scientific
     investigation requires not only skill but also knowledge that is specific to each practice.
                                                                                              NRC, 2012, p. 30
Including discussion of the practices in this section does not suggest that education should separate the
science and engineering practices from disciplinary core ideas. Students cannot fully appreciate the
nature of scientific knowledge without engaging with the science and engineering practices.
Second, science and engineering are dynamic:
     Second, a focus on practices (in the plural) avoids the mistaken impression that there is one
     distinctive approach common to all science—a single “scientific method”—or that uncertainty is a
     universal attribute of science. In reality, practicing scientists employ a broad spectrum of methods,
     and although science involves many areas of uncertainty as knowledge is developed, there are now
     many aspects of scientific knowledge that are so well established as to be unquestioned foundations
     of the culture and its technologies. It is only through engagement in the practices that students can
     recognize how such knowledge comes about and why some parts of scientific theory are more firmly
     established than others.
                                                                                              NRC, 2012, p. 44
Finally, the term “practices” is also used in standards instead of “inquiry” or “skills” to emphasize that
the practices are outcomes to be learned, not a method of instruction. The term “inquiry” has been used
in both contexts for so long that many educators do not separate the two uses. So the term “practices”
denotes the expected outcomes (development of skills) that result from instruction, whether instruction
is inquiry-based or not.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering                                      98


Rationale
Chapter 3 of the NRC Framework describes each of the eight practices of science and engineering and
presents the following rationale for why they are essential:
    Engaging in the practices of science helps students understand how scientific knowledge develops;
    such direct involvement gives them an appreciation of the wide range of approaches that are used to
    investigate, model, and explain the world. Engaging in the practices of engineering likewise helps
    students understand the work of engineers, as well as the links between engineering and science.
    Participation in these practices also helps students form an understanding of the crosscutting
    concepts and disciplinary ideas of science and engineering; moreover, it makes students’ knowledge
    more meaningful and embeds it more deeply into their worldview.[4]
    The actual doing of science or engineering can also pique students’ curiosity, capture their interest,
    and motivate their continued study; the insights thus gained help them recognize that the work of
    scientists and engineers is a creative endeavor—one that has deeply affected the world they live in.
    Students may then recognize that science and engineering can contribute to meeting many of the
    major challenges that confront society today, such as generating sufficient energy, preventing and
    treating disease, maintaining supplies of fresh water and food, and addressing climate change.
    Any education that focuses predominantly on the detailed products of scientific labor—the facts of
    science—without developing an understanding of how those facts were established or that ignores
    the many important applications of science in the world misrepresents science and marginalizes the
    importance of engineering.
                                                                                      NRC, 2012, pp. 42–43
This appendix describes what students should be able to do relative to each of these eight practices. The
charts presented in landscape format below are the “practices matrix”: the specific capabilities that
should be included in each practice for each grade span.
Scientific Inquiry and Engineering Design as Holistic and
Dynamic Processes
Scientific inquiry and engineering design are dynamic and complex processes. Each requires engaging in
a range of science and engineering practices to analyze and understand the natural and designed world.
They are not defined by a linear, step-by-step approach. While students may learn and engage in distinct
practices through their education, they should have periodic opportunities at each grade level to
experience the holistic and dynamic processes represented below and described in the subsequent two
pages.

                                                    Scientific Inquiry
   Asking questions and defining problems. Scientific questions arise in a variety of ways. They can be
   driven by curiosity about the world; inspired by the predictions of a model, theory, or findings from
   previous investigations; or stimulated by the need to solve a problem. Asking questions also leads to
   involvement in other practices.
   Developing and carrying out investigations. Scientific investigations may be undertaken to describe a
   phenomenon, or to test a theory or model. It is important to state the goal of an investigation, predict
   outcomes, and plan a course of action that generates data to support claims in laboratory or field
   experiences. Variables must be identified as dependent or independent and intentionally varied from
   trial to trial or controlled across trials. Field investigations involve deciding how to collect different
   samples of data under different conditions, even though not all conditions are under the direct control
   of the investigator. Planning and carrying out investigations likely includes elements of other practices.
   Analyzing and interpreting data. Analyzing data involves identifying significant features and patterns,
   using mathematics to represent relationships between variables, and considering sources of error.
   Computational thinking is central, involving strategies for organizing and searching data, creating
   sequences of steps, and using and developing simulations or models.
   Communicating evidence. Communicating explanations for the causes of phenomena is central to
   science. An explanation includes a claim that relates how a variable or variables relate to another
   variable or set of variables. A claim is often made in response to a question and in the process of
   answering the question. Argumentation is a process for reaching agreements about explanations and
   design solutions. Reasoning based on evidence is essential in identifying the best explanation for a
   natural phenomenon. Being able to communicate clearly and persuasively is critical to engaging with
   multiple sources of technical information and evaluating the merit and validity of claims, methods, and
   designs.

                                              Engineering Design
   Identify a need or a problem. To begin engineering design, a need or problem must be identified that
   an attempt can be made to solve, improve and/or fix. This typically includes articulation of criteria and
   constraints that will define a successful solution.
   Research. Research is done to learn more about the identified need or problem and potential solution
   strategies. Research can include primary resources such as research websites, peer-reviewed journals,
   and other academic services, and can be an ongoing part of design.
   Design. All gathered information is used to inform the creations of designs. Design includes modeling
   possible solutions, refining models, and choosing the model(s) that best meets the original need or
   problem.
   Prototype. A prototype is constructed based on the design model(s) and used to test the proposed
   solution. A prototype can be a physical, computer, mathematical, or conceptual instantiation of the
   model that can be manipulated and tested.
   Test and evaluate. The feasibility and efficiency of the prototype must be tested and evaluated relative
   to the problem criteria and constraints. This includes the development of a method of testing and a
   system of evaluating the prototype’s performance. Evaluation includes drawing on mathematical and
   scientific concepts, brainstorming possible solutions, testing and critiquing models, and refining the
   need or problem.
   Provide feedback. Feedback through oral or written comments provides constructive criticism to
   improve a solution and design. Feedback can be asked for and/or given at any point during engineering
   design. Determining how to communicate and act on feedback is critical.
   Communicate, explain, and share. Communicating, explaining, and sharing the solution and design is
   essential to conveying how it works and does (or does not), solving the identified need or problem, and
   meeting the criteria and constraints. Communication of explanations must be clear and analytical.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology/Engineering                          101


Assumptions for Science and Engineering Practices
The following assumptions guided the articulation and integration of the science and engineering
practices into the standards:
     •  Practices give students the skills necessary to engage in analytical thinking. Students must
        be able to use their knowledge and skills to analyze and understand scientific phenomena,
        designed systems, and real-world problems to successfully contribute to civic society and
        the economy. The science and engineering practices articulate the skills that are needed to
        achieve this.
     •  Students in grades pre-K–12 should engage in all eight practices over each grade span. All
        eight practices are accessible at some level to all children of every age. The matrix identifies
        only the capabilities students should acquire by the end of each grade span. Importantly,
        science and engineering practices should be generalizable across core ideas and particular
        concepts. Curriculum developers and educators determine the strategies that advance
        students’ abilities to use the practices.
     •  Practices grow in complexity and sophistication across the grades. Students’ abilities to use
        the practices grow over time. The NRC Framework suggests how students’ capabilities to
        use each of the practices should progress as they mature and engage in STE learning. While
        these progressions are derived from Chapter 3 of the NRC Framework, they are refined
        based on experiences in crafting the standards.
     •  Each practice may reflect science or engineering. Each of the eight practices can be used in
        the service of scientific inquiry and engineering design. One way to determine if a practice is
        being used for science or engineering is to ask about the goal of the activity. Is the goal to
        answer a question about natural phenomena? If so, students are likely engaged in science. Is
        the purpose to define and solve a problem to meet the needs of people? If so, students are
        likely engaged in engineering.
     •  Practices represent what students are expected to do; they do not represent teaching
        methods or a curriculum. The goal of standards is to describe what students should be able
        to do, rather than how they should be taught. The science and engineering practices are
        skills to be learned as a result of instruction; they do not define activities.
     •  The eight practices are not separate; they intentionally overlap and interconnect. As
        explained by Bell et al. (2012), the eight practices do not operate in isolation. Rather, they
        tend to unfold sequentially, and even overlap. For example, the practice of “asking
        questions” may lead to the practice of “modeling” or “planning and carrying out an
        investigation,” which in turn may lead to “analyzing and interpreting data.” The practice of
        “mathematical and computational thinking” may include some aspects of “analyzing and
        interpreting data.” Just as it is important for students to carry out each of the individual
        practices, it is important for them to see the connections among the eight practices.
     •  Standards focus on some but not all skills associated with a practice. The matrix identifies
        a number of particular skills for each practice, listing the components of each practice as a
        bulleted list within each grade span. Individual standards can include only one, or perhaps
        two, skills.
     •  Engagement in practices is language intensive and requires students to participate in
        relevant experiences and scientific and technical discourse. The practices offer rich
        opportunities and demands for language learning while advancing STE learning for all
        students (Lee et al., 2013).

Brief Description of Each Science and Engineering Practice
Each practice is described briefly below; for more information, see the NRC Framework (NRC, 2012).
The practices matrix follows the descriptions.
Practice 1. Asking Questions and Defining Problems
Scientific questions arise in a variety of ways. They can be driven by curiosity about the world;
inspired by the predictions of a model, a theory, or findings from previous investigations; or
stimulated by the need to solve a problem. Scientific questions are distinguished from other types of
questions in that the answers lie in explanations supported by empirical evidence, including
evidence gathered by others or through investigation.
While science begins with questions, engineering begins with defining a problem to solve. However,
engineering may also involve asking questions to define a problem, such as: What is the need or
desire that underlies the problem? What are the criteria for a successful solution? Other questions
arise when generating ideas, or testing possible solutions, such as: What are possible trade-offs?
What evidence is necessary to determine which solution is best?
Asking questions and defining problems also involves asking questions about data, claims that are
made, and proposed designs. It is important to realize that asking a question also leads to
involvement in another practice. A student can ask a question about data that will lead to further
analysis and interpretation. Or a student might ask a question that leads to planning and design, an
investigation, or the refinement of a design.
Practice 2. Developing and Using Models
Models include diagrams, physical replicas, mathematical representations, analogies, and computer
simulations. Although models do not correspond exactly to the real world, they bring certain
features into focus while obscuring others. All models contain approximations and assumptions that
limit the range of validity and predictive power, so it is important for students to recognize their
limitations.
In science, models are used to represent a system (or parts of a system) under study, to aid in the
development of questions and explanations, to generate data that can be used to make predictions,
and to communicate ideas to others. Students can be expected to evaluate and refine models
through an iterative cycle of comparing their predictions with the real world and then adjusting
them to gain insights into the phenomenon being modeled. As such, models are based on evidence.
When new evidence is uncovered that they cannot explain, models are modified.
In engineering, models may be used to analyze a system to see where or under what conditions
flaws might develop, or to test possible solutions to a problem. They can also be used to visualize
and refine a design or to communicate a design’s features. Prototypes are physical or simulated
instantiations of a model that can be manipulated and tested for specified variables, design
features, or functions.

Practice 3. Planning and Carrying Out Investigations
Scientific investigations may be undertaken to describe a phenomenon, or to test a theory or model
for how the world works. The purpose of engineering investigations might be to find out how to fix
or improve the functioning of a technological system or to compare different solutions to see which
best solves a problem. Whether students are doing science or engineering, it is always important for
them to state the goal of an investigation, predict outcomes, and plan a course of action that will
provide the best evidence to support their conclusions. Students should design investigations that
generate data to provide evidence to support claims they make about phenomena. Data are not
evidence until used in the process of supporting a claim. Students should use reasoning and
scientific ideas, principles, and theories to show why data can be considered evidence.
Over time, students should become more systematic and careful in their methods. In laboratory
experiments, students are expected to decide which variables should be treated as dependent or
independent; which should be treated as inputs and intentionally varied from trial to trial; and
which should be controlled, or kept the same across trials. In the case of field observations, planning
involves deciding how to collect different samples of data under different conditions, even though
not all conditions are under the direct control of the investigator. Planning and carrying out
investigations may include elements of all of the other practices.
Practice 4. Analyzing and Interpreting Data
    Once collected, data must be presented in a form that can reveal any patterns and relationships
    and that allows results to be communicated to others. Because raw data as such have little
    meaning, a major practice of scientists is to organize and interpret data through tabulating,
    graphing, or statistical analysis. Such analysis can bring out the meaning of data—and their
    relevance—so that they may be used as evidence.
    Engineers, too, make decisions based on evidence that a given design will work; they rarely rely
    on trial and error. Engineers often analyze a design by creating a model or prototype and
    collecting extensive data on how it performs, including under extreme conditions. Analysis of this
    kind of data not only informs design decisions and enables the prediction or assessment of
    performance but also helps define or clarify problems, determine economic feasibility, evaluate
    alternatives, and investigate failures.
                                                                                   NRC, 2012, pp. 61–62
As students mature, they expand their capabilities to use a range of tools for tabulation, graphical
representation, visualization, and statistical analysis. Students also improve their ability to interpret
data by identifying significant features and patterns, using mathematics to represent relationships
between variables, and taking into account sources of error. When possible and feasible, students
should use digital tools to analyze and interpret data. Students’ analysis and interpretation of data
result in evidence to support their conclusions.

Practice 5. Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking
Students are expected to use mathematics to represent physical variables and their relationships,
and to make quantitative predictions. Other applications of mathematics in science and engineering
include logic, geometry, and, at the highest levels, calculus. Computers and digital tools can enhance
the power of mathematics by automating calculations, approximating solutions to problems that
cannot be calculated precisely, and analyzing large data sets available to identify meaningful
patterns. Students are expected to use laboratory tools connected to computers for observing,
measuring, recording, visualizing, and processing data. Students are also expected to engage in
computational thinking, which involves strategies for organizing and searching data, creating
sequences of steps called algorithms, and using and developing new simulations of natural and
designed systems. Mathematics is a tool that is key to understanding science.
Practice 6. Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions
The goal of science is to construct explanations for the causes of phenomena. Students construct
their own explanations, as well as apply standard explanations they learn about through instruction.
The NRC Framework states the following about explanation:
    The goal of science is the construction of theories that provide explanatory accounts of the
    world. A theory becomes accepted when it has multiple lines of empirical evidence and greater
    explanatory power of phenomena than previous theories.
                                                                                       NRC, 2012, p. 52
An explanation includes a claim that relates how a variable or variables relate to another variable or
set of variables. A claim is often made in response to a question and in the process of answering the
question, scientists often design investigations to generate data.
The goal of engineering is to systematically solve problems. Engineering design involves defining the
problem, then generating, testing, and improving solutions. The NRC Framework describes this
practice as follows.
    The process of developing a design is iterative and systematic, as is the process of developing an
    explanation or a theory in science. Engineers’ activities, however, have elements that are distinct
    from those of scientists. These elements include specifying constraints and criteria for desired
    qualities of the solution, developing a design plan, producing and testing models or prototypes,
    selecting among alternative design features to optimize the achievement of design criteria, and
    refining design ideas based on the performance of a prototype or simulation.
                                                                                  NRC, 2012, pp. 68–69

Practice 7. Engaging in Argument from Evidence
Argumentation is a process for reaching agreements about explanations and design solutions. In
science, reasoning and argument based on evidence are essential in identifying the best explanation
for a natural phenomenon. In engineering, reasoning and argument are needed to identify the best
solution to a design problem. Student engagement in argumentation is critical if students are to
understand the culture in which scientists and engineers live, and how to apply science and
engineering for the benefit of society. As such, argument is a process based on evidence and
reasoning that leads to explanations acceptable by the scientific community and design solutions
acceptable by the engineering community.
Argument in science goes beyond reaching agreements in explanations and design solutions.
Scientists and engineers engage in argumentation when investigating a phenomenon, testing a
design solution, resolving questions about measurements, building data models, and using evidence
to evaluate claims. Whether investigating a phenomenon, testing a design, or constructing a model
to provide a mechanism for an explanation, students are expected to use argumentation to listen to,
compare, and evaluate competing ideas and methods based on their merits.
Practice 8. Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information
Being able to read, interpret, and produce scientific and technical text is a fundamental practice of
science and engineering, as is the ability to communicate clearly and persuasively. Being a critical
consumer of information about science and engineering requires the ability to read or view reports
of scientific or technological advances or applications (whether found in the press, on the Internet,
or at a town meeting) and to recognize the salient ideas, identify sources of error and
methodological flaws, distinguish observations from inferences, arguments from explanations, and
claims from evidence. Scientists and engineers use multiple sources of information to evaluate the
merit and validity of claims, methods, and designs. Communicating information, evidence, and ideas
can be done in multiple ways: using tables, diagrams, graphs, models, interactive displays, and
equations, as well as orally and in writing.

Appendix II
Essential Role of Language, Literacy, and Mathematics
for Science and Technology/Engineering Learning for
All Students
When language, literacy, and mathematics are integrated with STE through rich, relevant, and
experiential learning, all students are supported in developing understanding and facility with STE
concepts and skills.
Language and Literacy
Language and Literacy to Support STE Learning for All Students
Literacy skills are critical to building and applying knowledge in STE. Students become proficient in
reading, writing, listening, and speaking when they have a strong command of all three features of
academic language: word/phrase (including general and domain-specific vocabulary), sentence, and
discourse levels (WIDA, 2013; see chart on p. 18). Reading and writing in STE requires an
appreciation of the norms and conventions of the discipline of science, including understanding the
nature of evidence used, an attention to precision and detail, and the capacity to make and assess
intricate arguments, synthesize complex information, and follow detailed procedures and accounts
of events and concepts.
Each academic discipline presupposes specific kinds of background knowledge about text and
discourse features, as well as strategies for reading disciplinary texts. STE teachers are best
positioned to engage their students in disciplinary discourse as students experiment with using
productive comprehension strategies to learn with specific academic disciplines (Buehl, 2011). STE
teachers are immersed in academic language daily, and it is often hard to notice the skills we
habitually draw on to understand disciplinary language. It is important to make linguistic choices
explicit with students and become more aware of the complex ways in which disciplinary language
affects STE learning.
Creating an intentionally inclusive classroom culture relies on skilled facilitation that offers rich,
rigorous learning opportunities accessible for all learners. Effective engagement in any of the science
and engineering practices involves making sense of science through application and discourse. This
requires a contingent pedagogy that includes eliciting students’ prior knowledge, providing relevant
experiences to anchor discourse, and providing nuanced and flexible scaffolding that addresses a
progression of learning STE content. Every student benefits from careful attention to language in STE
instruction, including linguistically diverse students and students with disabilities.
Students also need to be able to gain knowledge from technical diagrams and mathematical data
that convey information and illustrate STE concepts. Likewise, writing information and presenting it
orally are key means for students to assert and defend claims in STE, demonstrate what they know
about a concept, and convey what they have experienced, imagined, thought, and learned. Students
benefit from discussion to clarify their thinking, build language proficiency, and prepare for writing
about STE concepts.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                            125


Purposeful planning of conversations enhances science learning and academic performance when
students have frequent opportunities to engage in collaboration and academic conversations with
their peers (Michaels & O’Connor, 2012). These conversations may range from short questions and
comments among students, as they investigate a phenomenon or problem, to more sustained
discussions that include presenting evidence to support a claim, critiquing a solution, or evaluating a
problem. They listen and process information as they present their ideas or engage in reasoned
argumentation with others to refine their ideas, critique others, and reach shared conclusions.
Students must also read, write, and visually represent ideas as they develop models and construct
explanations. The requirements and norms for classroom discourse are shared across all the STE
disciplines and, indeed, across all the subject areas.
All students stand to gain from effective STE instruction that involves experience with science and
engineering practices. Teachers must carefully plan to scaffold, modify, facilitate, and support all
students to access STE content and practices as well as language development. When supported
appropriately, all students can learn, comprehend, and carry out sophisticated language functions *
in STE contexts (e.g., arguing from evidence, providing explanations, developing models). For English
language learners in particular, the focus is on the developmental nature of language and the
careful use of instructional supports and scaffoldings so all students can participate in grade-level
curricula and higher-order thinking. For students with disabilities, knowing what they need to be
successful and providing differentiated ways for them to develop and communicate their
understanding is essential.
Role of Vocabulary in STE Instruction
Students need to have a facility for using technical terms in order to effectively learn complex STE to
communicate with others about their learning. In STE, vocabulary provides the labels used to
represent a concept or process. A vocabulary-rich classroom encourages students to link their
conceptual understanding with key scientific and technical terms. This promotes clearer and more
efficient communication about the content and enables shared understanding. Science and
engineering build knowledge over time through collaborative exchanges and peer review of new
knowledge and processes. As a student’s body of knowledge grows, their scientific and technical
vocabulary should grow with it. Without strong literacy skills, including the understanding and use of
scientific and technical vocabulary, students will have difficulty participating in STE endeavors or
understanding scientific and technical texts, even texts that are written for a general audience.
The STE standards represent specific choices about which vocabulary to include and which to omit in
defining learning outcomes. Where possible, a focus on the underlying scientific concept or process
has been emphasized and lists of scientific and technical terms have been minimized. In a few
instances, a state assessment boundary clarifies that certain terms will be excluded from state
assessments. The omission of such terms from the standards or the state assessment, however,
does not imply that students should not learn them. Educators should make deliberate choices
about which scientific and technical vocabulary to have students learn and use in their studies and
classroom discussions that can go beyond vocabulary used in the standards.
It is important to recognize that effective communication about STE includes more than vocabulary.
Language is an integral part of learning STE: not only a tool for communication, but also a tool for
      *
         “Language function” refers to the purpose for a particular use of language (e.g., recount, explain,
         argue). It is what students do with language to accomplish content-specific tasks.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                                  126


scientific thinking and reasoning. Students learn to engage in scientific thinking and reasoning by
making conjectures, presenting explanations, and constructing arguments, all of which require a
shared vocabulary to achieve more.
Mathematics
Mathematics is a language and a key tool used in STE. STE also provides an excellent context for
learning and applying mathematics. Students use mathematics in STE to represent physical
variables, describe relationships among variables, and make quantitative predictions. Computers
and digital tools can enhance the power of mathematics by automating calculations, approximating
solutions to problems that cannot be calculated precisely, and analyzing large data sets to identify
meaningful patterns. Students use laboratory tools connected to computers for observing,
measuring, recording, and processing data. Students also engage in computational thinking, which
involves strategies for organizing and searching data, creating sequences of steps (algorithms), and
using and developing new simulations of natural and designed systems.
Modeling is a particular area where STE and mathematics have significant overlap. Students develop
and use models in their STE classes to describe the complex systems in our natural world, and then
augment these models using mathematics. The descriptions, predictions, and analyses that such
mathematical models yield can be rich and dynamic and can include tables, graphs, equations,
algorithms, words, and computer simulations. Mathematics is a key tool for describing, predicting,
and analyzing the world.

Summary
Students experience and navigate the world as an integrated whole. Language, literacy, mathematics,
science, technology, and engineering are seamlessly interwoven in our everyday lives. The purposeful
attention to relationships across content areas strengthens STE learning for all students. The Venn
diagram below shows some ways in which these relationships overlap in state standards:
Relationships of disciplinary practices across the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks for
English Language Arts and Literacy, Mathematics, and Science and Technology/Engineering (based
on work by Tina Cheuk; ell.stanford.edu).
The disciplinary practices overlap and connect in multiple ways; with effective instruction, they
can make learning relevant and meaningful for all students. Attention to the discipline-specific
ways in which language is used within and across each of these areas is essential, as language is
the medium through which learning occurs and knowledge is exchanged in all classrooms.

Appendix III
Disciplinary Core Idea Progression Matrix
Each disciplinary core idea spans pre-K to high school, with each grade span representing a
reconceptualization or more sophisticated understanding of how students think about the core idea.
In subsequent grades the students’ thinking about a disciplinary core idea becomes more
sophisticated and closer to a scientific and technical perspective.
The Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012) provides specific criteria for what constitutes
a core idea. To be regarded as core, each idea must meet at least two, though preferably three or
four, of the following criteria:
    1.   Have broad importance across multiple sciences or engineering disciplines or be a key
         organizing principle of a single discipline.
    2.   Provide a key tool for understanding or investigating more complex ideas and solving
         problems.
    3.   Relate to the interests and life experiences of students or be connected to societal or
         personal concerns that require scientific or technological knowledge.
    4.   Be teachable and learnable over multiple grades at increasing levels of depth and
         sophistication. That is, the idea can be made accessible to younger students but is broad
         enough to sustain continued investigation over years.
                                                                                       NRC, 2012, p. 31
The landscape charts on the following pages present the “progression matrix” and briefly describe
the content at each grade span for each disciplinary core idea for pre-K–12. The full progressions can
be seen in the NRC Framework. Strand maps are another way to visualize the progressions (see
Appendix IV). This section does not endorse separating the disciplinary core ideas from science and
engineering practices in curriculum, instruction, or assessment.
Planning an STE curriculum at any grade level is most effective when it is known what students have
already been taught and what they should be learning in subsequent years. This matrix can be
helpful in planning and aligning curricula to recognize how standards relate across grade spans, build
upon each other, and may be integrated in curriculum. Core ideas do not, however, always define
the best units of instruction. Schools and districts will likely group standards in combinations other
than those shown in the matrix or in the standards themselves. Organizing the standards by
disciplinary core idea provides an opportunity to see how students are supported in learning any
one core idea from year to year.
Note that the core ideas for high school physical science are distributed across both introductory
physics and chemistry. These are presented next to each other, but they do not represent a
sequential progression from introductory physics to chemistry. The dotted line between them is
meant to indicate this.

Appendix IV
Strand Maps of Science and Technology/Engineering
Standards
The standards reflect coherent progressions of learning that support the development of core ideas
across grades. This makes it useful to visualize how concepts progress across grade spans and are
related across disciplines when planning and aligning curricula (horizontally and vertically).
Strand maps are designed for this purpose. Learning is facilitated when new and existing knowledge
is structured around core ideas rather than discrete bits of information. The strand maps show the
conceptual relationship between concepts in standards within and across grades.
     Sample STE strand map showing linked concepts from pre-K (left) to high school (right)
Individual teachers can use strand maps to identify concepts that should be the focus of pre-
assessment, to convey to students how the standard they are learning will contribute to future
learning, and to cluster standards into effective units of study. Schools and districts have found
strand maps to be particularly useful in vertical team meetings, curriculum mapping workshops, and
interdisciplinary meetings. Planning an STE curriculum at any grade level is most effective when it is
known what students have already been taught and what they will learn in subsequent years.
Features of Strand Maps
The strand maps are presented by discipline (e.g., life science, physical science) and grade span (pre-
K–5, middle and high school). Each discipline is identified by a thematic set of color-coded standards
(e.g., Earth and space science is a blue scheme) and each core idea is a consistent color. Please note
that pre-K–5 physical science includes technology/engineering and high school physical science
includes both introductory physics and chemistry. Topical examples (e.g., weather and climate,
states of matter and phase change) illustrate how concepts relevant to a particular topic relate
across disciplines and progress across grades.
Each strand map includes the full standards in individual cells, organized by the grade level or course
and color coded by discipline and core idea. Arrows link certain standards, highlighting how
concepts within particular standards are related and progress. An arrow leaving a standard implies
that the concept is fundamental to learning the concept of the next/connected standard—it would
be difficult to learn the next standard without knowing the previous/connected standard(s). In
addition to links among science standards, links from mathematics and English language arts
standards are also included in clear cells. Again, their inclusion implies that fluency with those
standards is an important contributor to learning the linked science standards. While the full STE
standard is included in each cell of the strand maps, the mathematics and literacy standards are only
indicated with their codes. The key below provides an overview of the structure of the strand maps.

                 Key showing the basic structure and components of an STE strand map.
The linking arrows do not represent connections or progressions of practices in the standards, only
concepts. Nor is there any particular research that suggests particular arrows are fixed or true; the
linking arrows reflect professional judgment by informed and experienced STE educators and
researchers.
The strand maps only represent conceptual connections and progressions across grades. For those
developing curricula or asking students to develop concept maps for particular topics or core ideas,
there would be many more possible connections between standards. The main idea of the strand
maps is to show how ideas and understanding develop over time, to visualize what contributes to a
student learning any particular standard and how that enables progressions of learning over time.
Accessing STE Strand Maps
The maps can be accessed on the Department’s website in several formats:

Appendix V
The Case for an Integrated Approach in Grades Pre-K–
8
The goal of a quality STE education is to produce scientifically and technologically literate citizens
who can solve complex, multidisciplinary problems through analytical and innovative thinking in
real-world applications needed for college and career success. An integrated model for the
Massachusetts pre-K to grade 8 STE standards reflects:
     •   That science is complex and multidisciplinary.
     •   Research on learning in science that shows expert knowledge develops through
         interdisciplinary connections, not isolated concepts or practices.
     •   Effective research-based practices for curriculum and instruction in science and engineering.
Science as Complex and Multidisciplinary
The nature of STE is complex and multidisciplinary. Scientists and engineers typically do not work in
isolated disciplines of physics, biology, or engineering: they create networks of professionals within
and across disciplines who can contribute knowledge, share ideas and methods, and critique
explanations and evidence. This is also the case when citizens collaborate to apply scientific and
technical knowledge to community or workplace applications. Important practices, such as engaging
in argument from evidence, modeling, and communicating information, do not occur in isolation but
are always in the context of disciplinary concepts and rely on feedback from within and across
scientific, technical, and workplace communities. Students’ understanding of science, technology,
and engineering as interdisciplinary and interconnected is enhanced by basing the pre-K to grade 8
standards in an integrated model with multiple disciplines at each grade. The cross-disciplinary
aspects reflected through the nature of science and crosscutting concepts reinforce the
multidisciplinary nature of STE (also see Appendix VIII).
Research on Learning in Science
Learning theory research shows that expert knowledge is developed more effectively when learning
is contextualized in interdisciplinary real-world connections than through isolated content or
practice (e.g., NRC, 2012; Schwartz et al., 2009). An integrated STE curriculum that reflects what we
know about the learning of science and how mastery develops over time promotes deeper learning
in science (e.g., Wilson et al., 2010). Students develop understanding more effectively while learning
content and practices together (e.g., NRC, 2005, 2009, 2012). Learning progressions recognize that
learning requires revision of networks of understanding, not revision of individual concepts (or
misconceptions) (e.g., Alonzo & Gotwals, 2012; Corcoran et al., 2009; NRC, 2012). If teachers
understand where their students are in their understanding of core ideas, and anticipate what
students’ misconceptions and struggles may be (e.g., Banilower et al., 2010; Driver et al., 1985,
1994; Keeley et al., 2005; Stanford University, 2012), they can better differentiate instruction and
provide scaffolding that allows students to develop an integrated, deeper understanding of the STE
content.
Attention to progressions of learning requires us to consider what concepts or skills a student must
learn first to effectively learn subsequent concepts. There are many such considerations within
disciplines, where the standards are built on progressions of specific disciplinary core ideas, and
others across or between disciplines. Attention to a progression of learning highlights how concepts
are sequenced and relate; this is a cognitive perspective that is distinct from a curricular perspective
in which many other connections or relationships can be made to define related sets of concepts for
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                            148


curriculum and instruction. The strand maps (see Appendix IV) highlight cognitive connections.
These provide guidance for ensuring that prerequisite concepts are established before others are
taught to support the learning of core ideas over time. This includes considerations of the
mathematics and literacy standards necessary to learn a particular STE standard.
Students should engage with science and engineering practices and concepts that range across
disciplines. Following this model through grade 8 allows students to build coherent understandings
and skills based upon coherent progressions of learning. In this way, the integrated approach to the
teaching and learning of science in pre-K to grade 8 respects learning as a purposeful progression.
Effective Science Curricula and Instruction
The Guiding Principles discuss the qualities of effective STE programs, highlighting the need for
coherence, connections, and relevance. Effective science curricula and instruction help pre-K to
grade 8 students to interrelate and apply science disciplines, link to their prior knowledge, and
analyze the world around them. Purposeful design of curricula and instruction scaffolds students to
understand the natural world in an increasingly scientifically accurate way and understand the
nature of science.
A Curricular Decision
A course curriculum should reflect a rationale, assumption, or belief about how students best
engage with the entire set of core ideas and practices. That rationale, assumption, or belief explains
and guides the placement of certain topics together in a particular grade and the sequence of topics
over years. These are often represented as grade-level themes, grade-span storylines, and/or
sequential knowledge construction that puts each particular topic into a context and makes learning
more relevant for students. Pre-K to grade 5 curricula and instruction are often designed in an
integrated approach by theme; the same is true for grade 6–8 curricula. The standards for grades
pre-K–8 have been articulated from this perspective, with a thematic rationale for each set of
standards for each grade. Note that just putting standards from multiple disciplines in one grade
does not necessarily result in integrated units of study: it allows for and even promotes that, but it is
up to districts, schools, and curriculum developers to determine the nature of the integration
through particular curriculum design. This approach provides a theme to each grade that informs
curricula, but does not define or constrain local curricular design.
The particular distribution of pre-K–5 STE standards is consistent with the NGSS. Massachusetts has
added an introductory paragraph to each grade to articulate its theme. Standards from each
discipline are generally aligned to the grade-level theme.
The middle school standards also include an integration of disciplines in each grade, organized by a
theme. Middle school curriculum design is more variable, although an integrated approach is the
most common. There are two common structures for middle school course design: those that
integrate the disciplines and those that are discipline-specific, focusing on one discipline each year.
Massachusetts Student Course Schedule data from the 2012–2013 school year for middle school
science showed that the vast majority of schools appear to take an integrated approach at each
grade. About 195,000 students were in integrated middle school science courses versus about
23,500 students in discipline-specific middle school science courses (please note there are some
inconsistencies with how schools use course codes, so there is some variability in the data). There is
not, however, any noticeably consistent or prevalent model for how integrated courses are defined,
constructed, or organized across districts. There is also no consistency in which discipline-specific
course sequence is used. An analysis of standards from 10 internationally competitive countries
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                           149


indicates that 7 of those 10 design integrated sequences from elementary through middle and even
early high school (Achieve, 2010). Given this evidence and the rationales presented above, the grade
6–8 standards are presented as integrated standards organized around a coherent theme.
Please note that state assessment (MCAS) will remain at grade 5 and grade 8 and assess the full
three-year grade-span in each case. Given this, districts can continue to organize the grade-by-grade
standards in any number of configurations to meet their locally designed curriculum. Presenting the
standards by grade level is intended to provide more continuity and consistency across schools and
districts, enhance support for resource development and sharing, and better address challenges
such as student transience.
Conclusion
A pre-K to grade 8 integrated model allows students to be equally prepared to enter introductory
physics, Earth and space science, biology, or technology/engineering in grade 9 without a gap of a
year or longer of being engaged in some of the core ideas of each domain. The specific and
deliberate sequencing of the standards can lead purposefully to the high school standards for each
STE discipline.
Presenting standards by grade provides clear and consistent guidance for pre-K to grade 8 and
allows districts and schools to align curricula, instruction, assessment, and professional development
to particular grades. Districts and schools will be able to share STE curriculum resources, teacher
professional development, district determined measures, and other resources. If a student transfers
between schools or districts in the state, there would be a common pathway and, hopefully, a less
abrupt change or gap in his/her science learning. An integrated approach for pre-K–8 reflects the
multidisciplinary nature of STE and research on science learning, curricula, and instruction.

Importance of Science and Engineering in Early
Education
Science and engineering are key components of early education (birth to age eight), and a natural
focus for young children who are beginning to develop their own understandings of the world and
how it works. By introducing children to science and engineering at a young age, we support their
curiosity, promote their understanding, and give them the tools they need to investigate, design,
observe, and draw evidence-based conclusions about the world. Children who are able to think
critically, solve problems, and base their ideas on evidence at an early age will have a strong
foundation as they engage with a world that is increasingly rooted in science, technology, and
engineering.
Young children are predisposed to doing and learning science and engineering. For them, it is a form
of high-level exploratory and constructive play that supports their critical thinking skills, problem-
solving abilities, and their social and emotional development. Much like scientists and engineers,
children want to make sense of the world and solve problems they see around them. Young children
ask “how” and “why” and “what if” questions about everything around them and are naturally
inclined to explore potential answers to their questions using all their senses. To build on their
natural curiosity, young children should be exposed to different scientific contexts and concepts to
help them refine and construct their thinking. This can be reinforced when science and engineering
are accessible and engaging, modeling interest, wonder, and enthusiasm.
Educators of young children can effectively support good science and engineering by engaging them
in science and engineering practices. Allowing children to pose questions and problems, and helping
them expand on ways to begin to answer those questions and solve those problems, gives students
the opportunity to be active participants in their own learning. Educators can give children varied
opportunities to engage in science and engineering practices and concepts, such as through hands-
on investigations, design projects, centers, literacy, and extended studies of natural phenomena.
Such approaches foster development of scientific and technical reasoning because it is connected to
their own experiences.
Science and engineering can also provide a compelling context for young children to learn literacy
and mathematics. Science and engineering experiences offer contexts to form the foundations of
reading, writing, speaking and listening, and language development. Young children encounter new
vocabulary, begin to use language in a variety of ways, create visuals to clarify ideas, and participate
in collaborative conversations with diverse partners to generate explanations and solutions. Science
and engineering also require the use of applied mathematics. Young children begin counting and
quantifying numbers and exploring shapes and the relationships among them. Integrating science
and engineering with literacy and mathematics engages children with the idea that the disciplines
work in conjunction with each other and builds a strong foundation as they advance to later grades
with more complex concepts and practices.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                           152


Aside from furthering academic development, science and engineering build young children’s
identity as scientists and engineers. Their curiosity and need to make sense of their environment
make science and engineering exciting and engaging parts of the early childhood experience.
Engaging curricula and instruction develop positive attitudes toward science and engineering and
allows children to develop knowledge and skills that will guide and enrich their lives. Allowing
children to explore the natural and human-made world though relevant experiences, in and out of
the classroom, supports their use of science and engineering to understand and interact with the
world.

Appendix VII
Science and Technology/Engineering Laboratories
The integration of science and engineering practices with disciplinary core ideas has direct
implications for the design of active learning experiences for students. This means students in STE
learning environments at all grade levels should regularly be mentally and physically engaged
(Clough, 2002). Current Massachusetts policy provides for districts to make local determinations of
what constitutes an inquiry- or design-based STE curriculum, and what constitutes the definition of a
“laboratory science” course (in high school). What should matter in defining quality STE learning
experiences is what students are doing, not where they are doing it.
STE experiences, at every level, need to account for appropriate physical space (e.g., MSBA, 2010),
reasonable equipment and materials, and safety (see Appendix XI).
Elementary Labs
There are many possibilities for pre-K–5 STE learning experiences, in the classroom or in and around
the school. Elementary grades should introduce students to practices and procedures that generally
start with teachers facilitating and leading students to observe and investigate natural phenomena,
interact with real objects and/or models, and collect and manipulate different types of data. As
students gain new knowledge, ask questions, and analyze and discuss evidence related to their
work, they can design and develop their own STE experiences. They learn to work together or
individually to carry out their own investigations, generate and design solutions, and use evidence to
communicate and demonstrate understanding.
The physical space allocated for pre-K–5 STE experiences can vary widely. Spaces that are more
open and have mobile tables can be configured to accommodate a variety of materials, equipment,
and experiences. However, STE experiences take place in a wide variety of settings, including
dedicated science classrooms, regular classrooms, athletic fields, school or community gardens, or
nearby parks.
STE equipment can include hand lenses, a variety of measuring tools, microscopes, hand tools,
interactive equipment, or computers that provide access to scientific databases, models,
simulations, and visualizations that are age appropriate for pre-K–5 students. (See Appendix XI for
information on safety in STE classrooms.)
Middle and High School Labs
Middle and high school lab experiences should offer a wide range of learning opportunities for STE
concepts and practices. Striking a balance between teacher-led lab experiences and student-driven
investigations is optimal for middle and high school students. Opportunities for students to interact
directly with natural phenomena, design problems to understand empirical data that they or others
may have collected, and grapple with scientific error, as they analyze, interpret, and debate their lab
findings, are essential for understanding science content and practices. Middle and high school
students can design and develop authentic lab experiences based on questions that emerge from
instruction and increase their ability to collaborate effectively.
The physical space allocated for STE labs varies depending on the types of experiences planned,
equipment needed, and the availability of resources. Generally, middle and high school lab spaces
are larger than a typical classroom to account for safety and equipment and have the flexibility to be
rearranged for difference types of experiences.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                         154


Lab equipment may include access to a water source and sinks, visible and accessible equipment,
measuring devices, safety equipment, refrigerators, dishwashers, heating equipment, and standing-
height and/or moveable tables. Other equipment found in labs can include hand tools, interactive
models and devices, and computers. (See Appendix XI for information on safety in STE classrooms.)
Defining “Laboratory Science” Courses in High School
The inclusion of science and engineering practices in the standards suggests that the key factor in
defining a “laboratory science” course is the nature and prevalence of the active learning
experience. A definition of such courses should include two critical elements:
    1. A balance between open and procedural investigations in which students learn and apply
         science and engineering practices.
    2. The percent of course time engaged in inquiry- or design-based experiences.
Any course aligned to the STE standards, including technology/engineering courses, can be
designated as a laboratory course. STE curricula should give students regular opportunities to
develop distinct science and engineering practices and occasional opportunities to apply those
together as a collective set of practices. A defined number of minutes, or an extra course period, can
be used for—but is not the critical feature of—a lab definition. “Laboratory science” does not have
to be in a laboratory; effective STE learning also occurs through field work, in a sufficiently supplied
traditional classroom, through project-based experiences, in well-designed virtual courses, and in
other learning environments (e.g., out of school time, see Appendix X). America’s Lab Report (NRC,
2006), which reviewed research and best practices across the country, supports these perspectives.

Appendix VIII
Value of Crosscutting Concepts and Nature of Science
in Curricula
Crosscutting Concepts in Curricula
Crosscutting concepts are overarching themes that emerge across all science and engineering
disciplines. These themes provide the context for disciplinary core ideas and enable students to
“develop a cumulative, coherent, and usable understanding of science and engineering” (NRC, 2012,
p. 4-1). Thus, crosscutting concepts bridge engineering, physical, life, and Earth/space sciences, and
offer increased opportunities for organizing science and technology/engineering curricula across
disciplines. The Framework for K–12 Science Education (NRC, 2012) defines crosscutting concepts as
“concepts that bridge disciplinary boundaries, having explanatory value throughout much of science
and engineering” (p. 83).
The NRC Framework identifies nine crosscutting concepts that bridge disciplines, uniting core ideas
across STE. These concepts are intended to help students deepen their understanding of the
disciplinary core ideas, and develop a coherent and scientifically based view of the world. They are:
    1. Patterns. Observed patterns of forms and events guide organization and classification, and
         they prompt questions about relationships and the factors that influence them.
    2. Cause and Effect: Mechanism and Explanation. Events have causes, sometimes simple,
         sometimes multifaceted. A major activity of science and engineering is investigating and
         explaining causal relationships and the mechanisms by which they are mediated. Such
         mechanisms can then be tested across given contexts and used to predict and explain
         events in new contexts or design solutions.
    3. Scale, Proportion, and Quantity. In considering phenomena or design solutions, it is critical
         to recognize what is relevant at different measures of size, time, and energy and to
         recognize how changes in scale, proportion, or quantity affect a system’s structure or
         performance.
    4. Systems and System Models. Defining the system under study—specifying its boundaries
         and making explicit a model of that system—provides tools for understanding and testing
         ideas that are applicable throughout science and engineering.
    5. Energy and Matter: Flows, Cycles, and Conservation. Tracking fluxes of energy and matter
         into, out of, and within systems, helps one understand the systems’ possibilities and
         limitations.
    6. Structure and Function. The way in which an object or living thing is shaped and its
         substructure determine many of its properties and functions.
    7. Stability and Change. For natural and built systems alike, conditions of stability and
         determinants of rates of change or evolution of a system are critical elements of study.
    8. Interdependence of Science, Engineering, and Technology. Scientific inquiry, engineering
         design, and technological development are interdependent.
    9. Influence of Engineering, Technology, and Science on Society and the Natural World.
         Scientific and technological advances can have a profound effect on society and the
         environment.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                         156


The NRC Framework notes that crosscutting concepts have been featured prominently in other
science documents about what all students should learn for the past two decades. They have been
called “common themes” in Science for All Americans (AAAS, 1989) and Benchmarks for Science
Literacy (AAAS, 1993), and “unifying concepts and processes” in National Science Education
Standards (NRC, 1996). Although these ideas have been consistently included in previous standards
documents, the NRC Framework recognizes that “students have often been expected to build such
knowledge without any explicit instructional support” (NRC, 2012, p. 83). Crosscutting concepts can
help students think of science learning not as memorization of isolated or disconnected facts, but as
integrated and interrelated concepts. This is a fundamental understanding of STE that requires
explicit instruction to help all students make connections among big ideas that cut across disciplines.
Principles for Integrating Crosscutting Concepts in Curricula
The NRC Framework recommends embedding crosscutting concepts in the STE curriculum beginning
in the earliest years of schooling and suggests a number of principles for how they can be used:
     •    Use crosscutting concepts in curricula and instruction to help students better understand
          core ideas in STE. When students encounter new phenomena or design problems—whether
          in a science lab, field trip, or on their own—they need mental tools to help engage in and
          come to understand the phenomena from a scientific and technological point of view.
          Familiarity with crosscutting concepts can provide that perspective. For example, when
          approaching a complex phenomenon (either a natural phenomenon or a mechanical
          system), it makes sense to begin by observing and characterizing the phenomenon in terms
          of patterns. A next step might be to simplify the phenomenon by thinking of it as a system
          and modeling its components and how they interact. In some cases it would be useful to
          study how energy and matter flow through the system, or to study how structure affects
          function (or malfunction). These preliminary studies may suggest explanations for the
          phenomena; these could be checked by predicting patterns that might emerge if the
          explanation is correct, then matching those patterns with those observed in the real world.
     •    Use crosscutting concepts in curricula and instruction to help students better understand
          science and engineering practices. Because these concepts address fundamental aspects of
          the world, they also inform the way humans attempt to understand it. Different crosscutting
          concepts align with different practices; when students carry out these practices, they are
          often addressing one of these crosscutting concepts. For example, when students analyze
          and interpret mathematical or visual data, they are often looking for patterns in
          observations. The practice of planning and carrying out an investigation is often aimed at
          identifying cause and effect relationships: If you poke or prod something, what will happen?
          The crosscutting concept of “Systems and System Models” is clearly related to the practice
          of developing and using models.
     •    Repeat crosscutting concepts in different contexts to build familiarity. While repetition is
          not a feature of the standards themselves, repeating crosscutting concepts within and across
          pre-K−12 helps them “become common and familiar touchstones across the disciplines and
          grade levels” (NRC, 2012, p. 83).
     •    Crosscutting concepts should grow in complexity and sophistication across the grades. As
          students grow in their understanding of the science disciplines, curricula should reflect an
          increasing depth of crosscutting concepts as well. The charts below (from the NGSS)
          describe increasingly sophisticated understandings of the crosscutting concepts across
          grade spans that can or should be integrated into curricula and instruction.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                           157


Progression of Crosscutting Concepts Across the Grades
Following is a brief summary of how each crosscutting concept increases in complexity and
sophistication across the grades. See the NRC Framework for a detailed description of the substance
and particulars of each.
1. Patterns
     Progression Across the Grades
     In grades pre-K–2, students can recognize that patterns in the natural and human-designed
     world can be observed, used to describe phenomena, and used as evidence.
     In grades 3–5, students can identify similarities and differences in order to sort and classify
     natural objects and designed products. They identify patterns related to time, including
     simple rates of change and cycles, and use these patterns to make predictions.
     In grades 6–8, students can recognize that macroscopic patterns are related to the nature of
     microscopic and atomic-level structure. They identify patterns in rates of change and other
     numerical relationships that provide information about natural and human designed systems.
     They use patterns to identify cause and effect relationships and use graphs and charts to
     identify patterns in data.
     In grades 9–12, students can observe patterns in systems at different scales and cite patterns
     as empirical evidence for causality in supporting their explanations of phenomena. They
     recognize that classifications or explanations used at one scale may not be useful or need
     revision using a different scale, thus requiring improved investigations and experiments. They
     use mathematical representations to identify certain patterns and analyze patterns of
     performance in order to re-engineer and improve a designed system.
2. Cause and Effect: Mechanism and Explanation
     Progression Across the Grades
     In grades pre-K–2, students can learn that events have causes that generate observable
     patterns. They design simple tests to gather evidence to support or refute their own ideas
     about causes.
     In grades 3–5, students can routinely identify and test causal relationships and use these
     relationships to explain change. They understand events that occur together with regularity
     might or might not signify a cause and effect relationship.
     In grades 6–8, students can classify relationships as causal or correlational and recognize that
     correlation does not necessarily imply causation. They use cause and effect relationships to
     predict phenomena in natural or designed systems. They also understand that phenomena
     may have more than one cause, and some cause and effect relationships in systems can only
     be described using probability.
     In grades 9–12, students can understand that empirical evidence is required to differentiate
     between cause and correlation and to make claims about specific causes and effects. They
     suggest cause and effect relationships to explain and predict behaviors in complex natural
     and designed systems. They also propose causal relationships by examining what is known
     about smaller-scale mechanisms within the system. They recognize that changes in systems
     may have various causes that may not have equal effects.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                          158


3. Scale, Proportion and Quantity
     Progression Across the Grades
     In grades pre-K–2, students can use relative scales (e.g., bigger and smaller, hotter and
     colder, faster and slower) to describe objects. They use standard units to measure length.
     In grades 3–5, students can recognize that natural objects and observable phenomena exist
     from the very small to the immensely large. They use standard units to measure and describe
     physical quantities such as weight, time, temperature, and volume.
     In grades 6–8, students can observe time, space, and energy phenomena at various scales,
     using models to study systems that are too large or too small. They understand phenomena
     observed at one scale may not be observable at another scale, and the function of natural
     and designed systems may change with scale. They use proportional relationships (e.g., speed
     as the ratio of distance traveled to time taken) to gather information about the magnitude of
     properties and processes. They represent scientific relationships through the use of algebraic
     expressions and equations.
     In grades 9–12, students can understand that the significance of a phenomenon is dependent
     on the scale, proportion, and quantity at which it occurs. They recognize that patterns
     observable at one scale may not be observable or exist at other scales, and some systems can
     only be studied indirectly as they are too small, too large, too fast, or too slow to observe
     directly. Students use orders of magnitude to understand how a model at one scale relates to
     a model at another scale. They use algebraic thinking to examine scientific data and predict
     the effect of a change in one variable on another (e.g., linear growth vs. exponential growth).
4. Systems and System Models
     Progression Across the Grades
     In grades pre-K–2, students can understand that objects and organisms can be described in
     terms of their parts and that systems in the natural and designed world have parts that work
     together.
     In grades 3–5, students can understand that a system is a group of related parts that make up
     a whole and can carry out functions its individual parts cannot. They can also describe a
     system in terms of its components and their interactions.
     In grades 6–8, students can understand that systems may interact with other systems; they
     may have sub-systems and be a part of larger complex systems. They can use models to
     represent systems and their interactions—such as inputs, processes, and outputs—and
     energy, matter, and information flows within systems. They can also learn that models are
     limited in that they only represent certain aspects of the system under study.
     In grades 9–12, students can investigate or analyze a system by defining its boundaries and
     initial conditions, as well as its inputs and outputs. They can use models (e.g., physical,
     mathematical, computer models) to simulate the flow of energy, matter, and interactions
     within and between systems at different scales. They can also use models and simulations to
     predict the behavior of a system, and recognize that these predictions have limited precision
     and reliability due to the assumptions and approximations inherent in the models. They can
     also design systems to do specific tasks.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                        159


5. Energy and Matter: Flows, Cycles, and Conservation
     Progression Across the Grades
     In grades pre-K–2, students can observe that objects may break into smaller pieces, be put
     together into larger pieces, or change shapes.
     In grades 3–5, students can learn that matter is made of particles and energy can be
     transferred in various ways and between objects. Students observe the conservation of
     matter by tracking matter flows and cycles before and after processes and recognizing that
     the total weight of substances does not change.
     In grades 6–8, students can learn that matter is conserved because atoms are conserved in
     physical and chemical processes. They also learn that, within a natural or designed system,
     the transfer of energy drives the motion and/or cycling of matter. Energy may take different
     forms (e.g., energy in fields, thermal energy, energy of motion). The transfer of energy can be
     tracked as energy flows through a designed or natural system.
     In grades 9–12, students can learn that the total amount of energy and matter in closed
     systems is conserved. They can describe changes of energy and matter in a system in terms of
     energy and matter flows into, out of, and within that system. They also learn that energy
     cannot be created or destroyed. It only moves between one place and another place,
     between objects and/or fields, or between systems. Energy drives the cycling of matter
     within and between systems. In nuclear processes, atoms are not conserved, but the total
     number of protons plus neutrons is conserved.
6. Structure and Function
     Progression Across the Grades
     In grades pre-K–2, students can observe that the shapes and stability of structures of natural
     and designed objects are related to their functions.
     In grades 3–5, students can learn that different materials have different substructures, which
     can sometimes be observed, and that substructures have shapes and parts that serve
     functions.
     In grades 6–8, students can model complex and microscopic structures and systems and
     visualize how their function depends on the shapes, composition, and relationships among its
     parts. They analyze many complex natural and designed structures and systems to determine
     how they function. They design structures to serve particular functions by taking into account
     properties of different materials and how materials can be shaped and used.
     In grades 9–12, students can investigate systems by examining the properties of different
     materials, the structures of different components, and their interconnections to reveal the
     system’s function and/or solve a problem. They infer the functions and properties of natural
     and designed objects and systems from their overall structure, the way their components are
     shaped and used, and the molecular substructures of their various materials.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                        160


7. Stability and Change
     Progression Across the Grades
     In grades pre-K–2, students can observe that some things stay the same while other things
     change, and things may change slowly or rapidly.
     In grades 3–5, students can measure change in terms of differences over time, and observe
     that change may occur at different rates. Students learn some systems appear stable, but
     over long periods of time they will eventually change.
     In grades 6–8, students can explain stability and change in natural or designed systems by
     examining changes over time, and considering forces at different scales, including the atomic
     scale. Students learn changes in one part of a system might cause large changes in another
     part, systems in dynamic equilibrium are stable due to a balance of feedback mechanisms,
     and stability might be disturbed by either sudden events or gradual changes that accumulate
     over time
     In grades 9–12, students can understand that much of science deals with constructing
     explanations of how things change and how they remain stable. They quantify and model
     changes in systems over very short or very long periods of time. They see some changes are
     irreversible, and negative feedback can stabilize a system, while positive feedback can
     destabilize it. They recognize that systems can be designed for greater or lesser stability.
8. Interdependence of Science, Engineering, and Technology
     Progression Across the Grades
     In grades pre-K–2, students can understand that science and engineering involve the use of
     tools to observe and measure things.
     In grades 3–5, students can describe how science and technology support each other. Tools
     and instruments are used to answer scientific questions, while scientific discoveries lead to
     the development of new technologies.
     In grades 6–8, students can identify that engineering advances have led to important
     discoveries in virtually every field of science, and that scientific discoveries have led to the
     development of entire industries and engineered systems. Science and technology drive each
     other forward.
     In grades 9–12, students can understand that science and engineering complement each
     other in the cycle known as research and development (R&D). Many R&D projects may
     involve scientists, engineers, and others with wide ranges of expertise.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                           161


9. Influence of Engineering, Technology, and Science on Society and the
Natural World
       Progression Across the Grades
       In grades pre-K–2, students can understand that every human-made product is designed by
       applying some knowledge of the natural world and is built by using natural materials. Taking
       natural materials to make things also makes an impact on the environment.
       In grades 3–5, students can describe that people’s needs and wants change over time, as do
       their demands for new and improved technologies. Engineers improve existing technologies
       or develop new ones to increase their benefits, decrease known risks, and meet societal
       demands. When new technologies become available, they can bring about changes in the
       way people live and interact with one another.
       In grades 6–8, students can understand that all human activity draws on natural resources
       and has both short and long-term consequences, positive as well as negative, for the health
       of people and the natural environment. The uses of technologies and any limitations on their
       use are driven by individual or societal needs, desires, and values; by the findings of scientific
       research; and by differences in such factors as climate, natural resources, and economic
       conditions. Technology use varies over time and from region to region.
       In grades 9–12, students can describe how modern civilization depends on major
       technological systems, such as agriculture, health, water, energy, transportation,
       manufacturing, construction, and communications. Engineers continuously modify these
       systems to increase benefits while decreasing costs and risks. New technologies can have
       deep impacts on society and the environment, including some that were not anticipated.
       Analysis of costs and benefits is a critical aspect of decisions about technology.
The Nature of Science in Curricula
An additional goal for pre-K–12 STE education is a scientifically and technologically literate person
who can understand the nature of scientific knowledge. Indeed, the key consistent characteristic of
scientific knowledge across the disciplines is that scientific knowledge itself is open to revision in
light of new evidence.
The NRC Framework summarizes the nature of science in the following statement:
     Epistemic knowledge is knowledge of the constructs and values that are intrinsic to science.
     Students need to understand what is meant, for example, by an observation, a hypothesis, an
     inference, a model, a theory, or a claim and be able to distinguish among them.
                                                                                      NRC, 2012, p. 79
Well-designed curricula should give students the opportunity to develop an understanding of the
enterprise of science as a whole. A key challenge for curricula is how to explain both the natural
world and what constitutes the formation of adequate, evidence-based scientific explanations. To
be clear, this perspective complements but is distinct from students engaging in scientific and
engineering practices in order to enhance their knowledge and understanding of the natural world.
The basic understandings about the nature of science include:
     1. Scientific investigations use a variety of methods.
     2. Scientific knowledge is based on empirical evidence.
     3. Scientific knowledge is open to revision in light of new evidence.
     4. Scientific models, laws, mechanisms, and theories explain natural phenomena.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                             162


     5.   Science is a way of knowing.
     6.   Scientific knowledge assumes an order and consistency in natural systems.
     7.   Science is a human endeavor.
     8.   Science addresses questions about the natural and material world.
The first four of these understandings are closely associated with practices and the second four with
crosscutting concepts. The Nature of Science matrix from NGSS, presented in the two tables below,
presents specific nature of science perspectives that can be integrated into curriculum and
instruction for each grade span.
Students can also be engaged in learning about the nature of science through study of scientists and
their work. Even though specific knowledge about these men and women is not included in the
standards and will not be subject to state assessment, students should learn about their lives and
discoveries, in order to provide them with greater insight into the real-life work of science and to
inspire them to pursue educational and career opportunities in STE fields. By way of example,
students should be able to recognize and discuss major scientific figures, such as Niels Bohr,
Nicolaus Copernicus, Marie Curie, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler,
Gregor Mendel, Isaac Newton, Louis Pasteur, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin.
Conclusion
The utility of crosscutting concepts and nature of science will be realized when curriculum
developers and teachers develop lessons, units, and courses that use these themes to tie together
the broad diversity of STE core ideas and practices. Doing so can help students organize and make
sense of relationships across disciplines and to engage in authentic STE.

context can make a curriculum relevant to students, helping them understand and apply core ideas
and practices. It can engage and motivate students to deepen their understanding, apply their
learning, build identity as civic participants, communicate their ideas, and prepare for college and
careers.
Relevant contexts can be drawn from science, technology, and engineering in society; nature and
history of science; cultural and technological perspectives; current issues; community issues; and a
variety of professions. Listed below are examples of specific contexts or topics that can be used to
effectively teach Massachusetts’ STE standards. Educators can use one or more of them to design an
entire unit, theme, or course. They can be applied to elementary, middle, or high school curricula.
Biotechnology
Biotechnology is a rapidly expanding field that uses a growing set of techniques to derive valuable
products from organisms and their cells. Biotechnology is already commonly used to identify
potential suspects in crimes or exonerate persons wrongly accused, determine paternity, diagnose
diseases, make high-yield pest-resistant crops, and treat genetic ailments. Introducing students to
biotechnology as a way of understanding the molecular basis of heredity can highlight the
application and importance of related biological concepts and processes. Biotechnology can also
provide students with methods and critical thinking skills needed to evaluate the benefits and risks
of this technology.
Green Chemistry
Green chemistry provides a framework and lens for learning, teaching, and investigating chemistry
concepts. Green chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or
eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances. Introducing students to green chemistry
helps them to incorporate chemistry concepts into relevant contexts, particularly when applied to
the life cycle of a chemical product, including its design, manufacture, use, and disposal. Green
chemistry also gives students opportunities to explain and research how to reduce the negative
impacts of chemical products and processes on human health and the environment.
Ocean Literacy
The ocean covers most of the planet, contains important food sources, and regulates the
temperature and climate of the globe. Massachusetts is a coastal state: the ocean affects us in many
ways, and we affect the ocean. People’s actions, such as overfishing, habitat destruction, and
actions leading to climate change, have negative effects on the health of the planet and our state.
Increasing ocean literacy helps to build a public that can make informed and responsible decisions
about their own community. Ocean literacy can help students develop an understanding of
the interdisciplinary nature of ocean sciences and build connections between the ocean, its
resources, and human actions.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                         169


Environmental Literacy/Sustainability
Environmental literacy is focused on a fundamental understanding of the systems of the natural
world and the relationships and interactions between the living and non-living environments. It
involves the ability to understand scientific evidence and use it to make informed decisions
regarding environmental issues, as well as developing and implementing solutions to key challenges.
The concept of sustainability comes from the increasing concern that current patterns of human
behavior, such as over-consumption and population growth, could lead to negative consequences
for the environment, including human populations. Environmental literacy can give students a
framework for understanding our natural resources, connected systems, and how to balance
environmental needs across communities. It also can provide students with methods to evaluate the
various viewpoints on environmental topics so they can think critically about the issues facing the
environment.
Forensics
Forensic sciences include any scientific field that is applied to the field of law. Forensics is a
necessary factor in criminal investigations, using science to link a crime to its perpetrator. It is an
excellent context to show students the diversity of scientific and technical careers, both in the lab
and in the field. The interdisciplinary nature of forensics requires students to apply core ideas from
different disciplines, critically analyze information, construct explanations based on evidence, and
communicate findings.
Clean Energy/Renewable Energy
Clean energy, or renewable energy, has gained increased interest as society’s demand for energy
increases. Government, industry, and communities are seeking innovative ways to meet their
energy needs. Clean energy uses natural sources (e.g., sunlight, geothermal energy, wind) to
produce energy such as electricity. From wind to solar to biomass, Massachusetts has increased its
diversity of energy resources. Using clean energy to illustrate how STE is interconnected helps
students to appreciate the complexities of energy issues. Clean energy provides many different
examples of how science, technology, and engineering influence each other and how aspects of
each discipline play a role in helping explain and connect concepts, practices, and applications.
Computer Science
Computer science includes a wide variety of applications across many different fields—
entertainment, medicine and health care, finance, and astronomy, among many others. Daily
changes in technology, communication, and the information life cycle have contributed to the
changing face of society and the practice of science and engineering. This is an exciting and creative
pursuit, which involves designing and building software; developing effective ways to solve
computing problems; collecting and analyzing new and larger data sets; and devising new and better
ways of using computing devices, digital tools, and software to address particular challenges, such as
robotics, computer vision, or digital forensics.
Nanotechnology
Nanotechnology is the study and application of micro-scale materials being used across all fields of
science and technology. Nanotechnology is used to make everything from stain-proof clothing to
microfilms to medicine. Nanobots created by engineers who work on a very tiny scale could
revolutionize medicine and manufacturing. Curricula focused on nanotechnology can make students
aware of how nanotechnology is transforming tools, techniques, and highly advanced products, and
engage them in applying core ideas and practices from a variety of disciplines.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                             170


Appendix X
The Value of Out of School Time Programming
Out of school time (OST) programming can be an effective complement to school day learning.
OST programs can offer opportunities for students to immerse themselves in a variety of STE
experiences to gain new skills and knowledge, apply school learning, and develop literacy and
fluency in different contexts. OST programs can include before- and after-school programs;
weekend and summer (or vacation week) programs and camps; informal learning centers, such as
museums, zoos, nature centers, and community gardens; summer learning experiences; or youth
clubs and internships that focus on youth development.
Interest and Engagement
STE programming in OST learning environments can capitalize on students’ interest about the
world in which they live and can offer multiple contexts that promote active engagement.
Students can spend more time focused on a science activity or an engineering challenge that is of
particular interest to them. Many OST programs offer peer networks that foster sustained
participation with students and families. This sustained engagement and freedom within
informal, flexible learning time motivates students as they develop mastery and competency with
science concepts and practices in OST programs.
Identity
Developing an STE identity involves multiple elements, such as getting young people interested in
STE topics and professions, developing competency and a sense of confidence, and getting all
youth to envision themselves as potential contributors and participants in this enterprise (NRC,
2012). OST programming that provide students with STE mentors or opportunities to engage with
STE professionals allows them to build relationships and develop their ideas about the types of
people who work in these fields. STE professionals serve as role models whom students can ask
questions about how they became interested in their career, what happens on a daily basis in
their work, and how they contribute to their community. Such experiences can be particularly
beneficial to girls’ perceptions and career goals (Tan et al., 2013).
Relevance
OST programming that offers STE experiences can also increase students’ awareness of the
relevance of science in their lives and prepare them for active citizenship with compelling local,
regional, or global issues, such as energy resources, water quality, invasive organisms, and
erosion. These experiences can give students a chance to spend more time investigating
phenomena, problems, and solutions than they can during the school day. Strategies that involve
the community underscore the importance of connecting the school science curriculum to
students’ lives and the community in which they live. It is through such connections that students
who may traditionally be alienated from science recognize science as relevant to their lives and
future and deepen their understanding of STE concepts and practices (NRC, 2015). The community
context for science education capitalizes on community resources and makes science more
culturally, linguistically, and socially relevant for diverse student groups (González et al., 2005).
Students can develop critical consciousness of social inequity especially as such inequities exist in
their communities. STE experiences in OST programs can contribute to students’ awareness and
understanding of the connection and value of STE in addressing and solving societal issues.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                           171


Career and Life Skills
OST programs can offer students essential life and career skills, such as working in teams and
communicating ideas to a variety of audiences. Students who interact with STE professionals are
more aware of career paths and options, as well as an understanding of what these potential jobs
entail. OST programs often provide STE field trips that engage students in a variety of activities
and offer different perspectives on science, technology, and engineering skills and careers.
Schools and teachers are a critical part of students’ STE education, but are only one part of a
larger system of what students need to achieve success in K–12 and beyond. OST programs that
strive to enhance STE learning opportunities for all students focus on creating engaged young
citizens who can contribute to a dynamic and dexterous workforce and develop the capacity and
competencies needed to contribute to their community and the innovation economy. What
happens outside school can be equally as important as what happens in school in setting a child’s
direction, activating their interest, and developing their understanding of the role of STE in their
dynamic world (Noam et al., 2013).

Appendix XI
Safety Practices and Legal Requirements
Safe practices are integral to teaching and learning of STE at all levels. It is the responsibility of each
district to provide safety information and training to educators and students and the responsibility
of each educator to understand and implement safe laboratory practices. This section describes the
laboratory safety practices that are required by law, as well as resources that provide guidance on
general safety practices.
Duty of Care of Adults Teaching Science
As professionals, teachers of science have a duty of care to ensure the safety of students, teachers,
and staff. (“Duty of care” is defined as an obligation, recognized by law, requiring conformance to a
certain standard of conduct to protect others against unreasonable risk.) Accordingly, a science
educator must act as a reasonably prudent person would in providing and maintaining a safe
learning environment for students. *
A reasonably prudent teacher:
     •    Provides prior warning of any hazards associated with an activity.
     •    Demonstrates the essential portions of the activity.
     •    Provides active supervision.
     •    Provides sufficient instruction to make the activity and its risks understandable.
     •    Ensures that all necessary safety equipment is available and in good working order.
     •    Has sufficient training and equipment available to handle an emergency.
     •    Ensures that the place of the activity is as safe as reasonably possible. †
Additionally, a science teacher must be able to provide an educational justification for engaging in
any activity associated with an inherent safety risk.
Legal Aspects of Laboratory Safety
Educators should be aware of the legal framework outlined below in planning for the design,
construction, and implementation of science instruction, classrooms and laboratories:
Applicable Massachusetts Law
1. Safety Goggles
     Wearing protective goggles in school laboratories is required by Massachusetts law.
     Mass. Gen. Laws c. 71, § 55C, states:
     Each teacher and pupil of any school, public or private, shall, while attending school classes in
     industrial art or vocational shops or laboratories in which caustic or explosive chemicals, hot
     liquids or solids, hot molten metals, or explosives are used or in which welding of any type, repair
     or servicing of vehicles, heat treatment or tempering of metals, or the milling, sawing, stamping
     or cutting of solid materials, or any similar dangerous process is taught, exposure to which may
     be a source of danger to the eyes, wear an industrial quality eye protective device, approved by
     the department of public safety. Each visitor to any such classroom or laboratory shall also be
     required to wear such protective device.
*
  National Science Teachers Association (NSTA). (2007). NSTA position statement: Liability of science educators
for laboratory safety. Retrieved from www.nsta.org/docs/PositionStatement_Liability.pdf
†
  Maryland Department of Education. (1999). Legal aspects of laboratory safety. In Science safety manual.

Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                                 173


    Thus, all individuals in the laboratory are required to wear goggles if they are using any of the
    materials or procedures listed in the statute. It is critically important for teachers to make students
    aware of the hazards of working with chemicals and open flame in the laboratory and other
    settings and to be sure they wear goggles to protect their eyes. (Wearing protective goggles is
    also an Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] standard—1910.133.)
2. Treatment of Animals
    Animals should be treated with care and dissection should be confined to the classroom and
    undertaken for academic purposes.
    Mass. Gen. Laws c. 272, § 80G, states:
    No school principal, administrator or teacher shall allow any live vertebrate to be used in any
    elementary or high school under state control or supported wholly or partly by public money of
    the state as part of a scientific experiment or for any other purpose in which said vertebrates are
    experimentally medicated or drugged in a manner to cause painful reactions or to induce painful
    or lethal pathological conditions, or in which said vertebrates are injured through any other type
    of treatment, experiment or procedure including but not limited to anesthetization or electric
    shock, or where the normal health of said animal is interfered with or where pain or distress is
    caused.
    No person shall, in the presence of a pupil in any elementary or high school under state control
    or supported wholly or partly by public money of the state, practice vivisection, or exhibit a
    vivisected animal. Dissection of dead animals or any portions thereof in such schools shall be
    confined to the classroom and to the presence of pupils engaged in the study to be promoted
    thereby, and shall in no case be for the purpose of exhibition.
    Live animals used as class pets or for purposes not prohibited in paragraphs one and two hereof
    in such schools shall be housed or cared for in a safe and humane manner. Said animals shall not
    remain in school over periods when such schools are not in session, unless adequate care is
    provided at all times.
    The provisions of the preceding three paragraphs shall also apply to any activity associated with
    or sponsored by the school.
    Whoever violates the provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than one
    hundred dollars.
For further discussion on the Board of Education’s policy on the dissection of animals, please consult
Appendix XII.
3. “Right to Know”
People who work with hazardous chemicals have a “right to know” the dangers and nature of these
chemicals.
Mass. Gen. Laws c. 111F, § 7(a), states:
    Except as otherwise provided by this section, an employer shall label with the chemical name
    each container in his or her workplace containing a toxic or hazardous substance. Said label shall
    also contain the proper NFPA [National Fire Protection Association] Code applicable to any
    contents of the container for which an NFPA Code has been published in NFPA 49, Hazardous
    Chemical Data, but only in those instances where the container contains more than five gallons
    or thirty pounds of materials to which the NFPA Code is applicable.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                             174


Thus, laboratory managers must make sure that all posters, labels, Safety Data Sheets (SDSs), etc.,
describing and explaining the dangers of hazardous chemicals are clearly displayed and current.
4. Mercury
Schools are not to have mercury, including equipment or materials containing mercury, on the
premises (with limited exceptions), and any mercury-added products must be disposed of
appropriately.
Mass. Gen. Laws c. 21H, § 6G (as amended by Chapter 190 of the Acts of 2006, effective October 1,
2006), states:
    No school in the commonwealth shall purchase for use in a primary or secondary classroom
    elemental mercury, mercury compounds or mercury-added instructional equipment and
    materials, except measuring devices and thermometers for which no adequate nonmercury
    substitute exists that are used in school laboratories. This section shall not apply to the sale of
    mercury-added lamps or those products whose only mercury-added component is a mercury-
    added lamp or lamps.
Mass. Gen. Laws c. 21H, § 6I (as amended by Chapter 190 of the Acts of 2006, effective May 1,
2008), states:
    (a) No person, household, business, school, healthcare facility or state or municipal government
    shall knowingly dispose of a mercury-added product in any manner other than by recycling,
    disposing as hazardous waste or using a method approved by the department [of environmental
    protection].
Relevant Federal Law
1. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
    Public schools are required to comply with provisions of the ADA. Students with disabilities are
    entitled to a level of laboratory experience appropriate to them as individuals. The ADA was
    amended in 2008 to allow for coverage of a broad range of disabilities, including allergies that
    would substantially impair a major life activity in the absence of mitigating factors. As a result,
    teachers must take additional precautions to ensure that reasonable accommodations are made
    for students who are allergic to materials used in the science lab (see “Additional Resources” for
    guidance on latex allergies).
2. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
    The Occupational Safety and Health Act requires that certain precautions be observed and
    certain actions taken to protect the health and safety of employees on the job. As public
    employees, school building staff are covered by OSHA according to the 2019 update to Mass.
    Gen. Laws c. 149 § 6½; OSHA protections afforded to staff should be extended to students via
    policy and practice.
    Under OSHA, districts must appoint a Chemical Hygiene Officer and Chemical Hygiene Officers
    must have and enforce a Chemical Hygiene Plan that meets OSHA Laboratory Standards. The
    following resources should be referenced to update or develop Chemical Hygiene Plans:
    • OSHA Laboratory Standard Fact Sheet
         (https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAfactsheet-laboratory-safety-osha-lab-
         standard.pdf) includes requirements for Chemical Hygiene Plans:
             o functional PPE (personal protective equipment), engineering controls, and fire
                  safety equipment
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                             175


               o   management of all chemical use, storage, safety, and protocols
                         identify necessary precautions and hazards through the chemical provider’s
                            Safety Data Sheets (SDS) or through an online SDS database
               o provide employee training

          Learning Spaces (https://www.massschoolbuildings.org/programs/science_lab) includes
          best practices and resources for designing and managing safe spaces
    The following OSHA Standards are of heightened relevance to science teachers:
    • Limiting the exposure to hazardous chemicals (1910.1450)
          (www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10106)
               o Chemical Hygiene Officers must have and enforce a Chemical Hygiene Plan that
                   ensures that proper protective gear is used, trains those working in the laboratory,
                   etc.
    • Limiting the exposure to blood-borne pathogens (1910.1030)
          (www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10051)
               o Chemical Hygiene Officers should have an exposure control plan; provide hand
                   washing facilities; ensure that lab workers wash hands right after the removal of
                   gloves; dispose of contaminated needles and other sharp instruments in puncture-
                   proof, non-leak containers; prohibit the application of cosmetics, changing of
                   contact lenses, and other such practices in the laboratory; provide proper protective
                   eye, hand, and face equipment, etc.
    • Providing information about the hazardous chemicals in use in the laboratory (1910.1200)
          (www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10099)
               o 1910.1200(b)(1): All employers must “provide information to their employees about
                   the hazardous chemicals to which they are exposed, by means of a hazard
                   communication program, labels and other forms of warning, safety data sheets, and
                   information and training.”
    • Using hand protection when handling potentially dangerous substances (1910.138)
          (www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=9788)
               o 1910.138(a): “Employers shall select and require employees to use appropriate
                   hand protection when employees’ hands are exposed to hazards such as those from
                   skin absorption of harmful substances; severe cuts or lacerations; severe abrasions;
                   punctures; chemical burns; thermal burns; and harmful temperature extremes.”
               o 1910.138(b): “Employers shall base the selection of the appropriate hand protection
                   on an evaluation of the performance characteristics of the hand protection relative
                   to the task(s) to be performed, conditions present, duration of use, and the hazards
                   and potential hazards identified.”
3. Restrictions on Use of Migratory Birds
Individuals are not allowed to acquire live or dead migratory birds, nests, or eggs, or to use them as
lab animals.
Under federal law, 16 U.S.C. § 703(a) states:
    [I]t shall be unlawful at any time, by any means or in any manner, to pursue, hunt, take, capture,
    kill, attempt to take, capture, or kill, possess, offer for sale, sell, offer to barter, barter, offer to
    purchase, purchase, deliver for shipment, ship, export, import, cause to be shipped, exported, or
    imported, deliver for transportation, transport or cause to be transported, carry or cause to be
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                                   176


   carried, or receive for shipment, transportation, carriage, or export, any migratory bird, any part,
   nest, or eggs of any such bird, or any product, whether or not manufactured, which consists, or is
   composed in whole or part, of any such bird or any part, nest, or egg thereof, included in the
   terms of the conventions between the United States and Great Britain for the protection of
   migratory birds concluded August 16, 1916 (39 Stat. 1702)
Thus, it is illegal to acquire any migratory bird, whether alive or dead, or their eggs or nests, for any
purpose, including for use within a classroom or lab.

2. Special Considerations for the Collection, Handling, and Analysis of Human Biological Material
   • Safe collection and handling of samples:
               o The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Universal Precautions for
                    preventing transmission of bloodborne infections, as well as federal regulations at
                    29 CFR § 1910.1030, must be followed when human samples are used in
                    laboratories:
                         www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/universal.html
                         www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards
                            &p_id=10051
               o In addition to the Universal Precautions, teachers using human body samples should
                    take the following precautions:
                         Students must be allowed to collect samples only with the supervision and
                            advice of the teacher.
                         Samples must be handled with plastic or latex gloves, chemical splash safety
                            goggles, and a laboratory coat or apron.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                             177


                         Students must always wash their hands after any laboratory activity
                          involving human body samples. ‡
   •   Privacy considerations:
            o The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy
                 of student education records in general, including all of the medical information
                 they contain (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR § 99). Under FERPA, schools must grant
                 parents and eligible students the right to access student records, and must obtain
                 consent before disclosing records. Schools must be mindful of FERPA requirements
                 in developing policies for the handling of student medical information collected in
                 science laboratory activities. For more information on FERPA, visit

8. Choking Hazards
Some materials commonly used in science labs and lessons (for example, latex balloons) may pose
choking hazards for small children. Teachers should be aware of the risks posed by these materials
and take necessary precautions to prevent choking. See HealthyChildren.org for more information:
www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/Choking-
Prevention.aspx
9. Electricity
When electricity is used in experiments, students must be warned of risk of shock, even when
voltage is low.
Electrostatic generators. The Maryland Department of Education’s Science Safety Manual § states
that:
    Electrostatic generators used in demonstrations of static electricity produce high
    voltages (about 105 volts) with very low currents. The danger of these generators
    depends on their size and capacity to produce enough current to be dangerous. In many
    cases the shock from such devices is very quick and not harmful. The startling effect,
    however, can be detrimental to persons with heart conditions.
    In general, experiments that use human subjects to demonstrate the effect of electrical
    shock should not be attempted due to the large variation in physical and physiological
    factors. Leyden jars—which can be charged with electrostatic generators—are especially
    dangerous because of their capacity to store a charge for long periods of time. An
    accidental discharge through a person can be avoided by properly shorting the devices
    after use.

Sample Safety Guidelines
Science staff should actively work to set safety policies, expectations, and classroom practices for
their school and district. Example safety guidelines for the science classroom are included on the
following pages. This example is excerpted from the Council of State Science Supervisors’ Science
and Safety: It’s Elementary, found at www.csss-science.org/safety.shtml. This is not necessarily a

Appendix XII
Dissection and Dissection Alternatives in Science
Courses: Policies and Resources for Massachusetts
Public Schools
Introduction
This appendix, approved by the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education in October 2005 as a
guidance document, is designed to help district and school personnel implement the Board’s policy
on dissection and dissection alternatives in science courses. It also provides a variety of alternative
resources to actual dissection.
State Policy
The Board-approved policy on dissection and dissection alternatives states:
     All public schools that offer dissection as a learning activity should, upon written request by a
     student’s parent or guardian, permit a student who chooses not to participate in dissection to
     demonstrate competency through an alternative method.
Educators teaching life science consider dissection to be an important educational tool. But
dissection should be used with care. When animal dissection is considered, teachers should
recognize that there are other experiences (e.g., computer programs) for students who choose not
to participate in actual dissections.
Further, as described in Mass. Gen. Laws c. 272, § 80G, and in Appendix XI, dissection should be
confined to the classroom: “Dissection of dead animals or any portions thereof in…schools shall be
confined to the classroom and to the presence of pupils engaged in the study to be promoted
thereby and shall in no case be for the purpose of exhibition.” This law covers treatment of animals
in school settings (not just dissection). Please refer to Appendix XI for further information
concerning the treatment of animals and dissection in the classroom.
Recommendations for School and Districts
1. Schools should be responsible about both the use of live animals and dissection of dead
     animals in the classroom.
     Schools and school districts should ensure that animals are properly cared for and treated
     humanely, responsibly, and ethically. The National Science Teachers Association’s
     recommendations on how to include live animals and dissection of dead animals in the
     classroom can be found at www.nsta.org/about/positions/animals.aspx.
2. Schools should develop clear policies on dissection and dissection alternative activities.
     Schools and school districts should establish a written policy on courses that include animal
     dissection. The policy should state that options are available for students who object to
     dissection activities and that, upon written request by a student’s parent or guardian, the school
     will permit that student to demonstrate competency through an alternative method. The policy
     should specify the available alternatives and explain how a student can participate in such an
     alternative.
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                            185


The teacher, or other school authority, should specify in writing what is expected of the student
participating in an alternative activity. The activity itself should allow students to gain the same
content knowledge as a dissection activity and should involve a comparable investment of time and
effort by the student. The students should be subject to the same course standards and
examinations as other students in the course.
         The school’s policy on dissection and dissection alternatives should be included in the
         student handbook. The school should also provide a copy of the policy at the beginning of
         the school year to all teachers of science courses that involve dissection. A sample school
         policy and sample form letter for parents/guardians are included at the end of this
         appendix.
3. Schools should include information about dissection in relevant course descriptions, and
    should clearly specify dissection alternatives in that information.
    When the school or school district publishes descriptions of the courses that it offers in the life
    sciences, the description for each course should specify whether dissection is part of the
    standard laboratory experience in that course. The course description should also state that
    alternatives to dissection are available for any student who objects to dissection and whose
    parent or guardian sends a written request to the school.

2. Resources on alternatives to dissection
    A number of organizations will loan or donate alternatives, such as CD-ROMs (virtual
    dissections), models, and videos to students and schools. The following organizations have free
    lending libraries and will help teachers find a suitable alternative to a dissection activity. (Often
    a security deposit is required, but no charges are incurred unless the items are not returned or
    are returned damaged. The borrower is responsible for return shipping.) Also available are
    mobile apps (most requiring a purchase) that allow virtual dissection of a variety of organisms.

3. Sample School Policy and Sample Form Letter for Parents/Guardians
   A sample school policy and a sample form letter for parents/guardians are provided on the following
   pages.
   Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                     189


                                             Sample School Policy
   POLICY ON DISSECTION AND DISSECTION ALTERNATIVES
   In accordance with the 2005 Board of Elementary and Secondary Education’s Policy on
   Dissection and Dissection Alternatives, our school/school district has developed the following
   policy.
   Participation in hands-on science is important to learning science, and dissections are a valuable
   learning experience in which all students are encouraged to participate. When dissection is used
   in the classroom:
   Teachers will thoroughly explain the learning objectives of the lesson and use written and audio-
        visual materials, as appropriate, to maximize the educational benefits of the experience.
   All specimens will be treated with respect.
   All students will be informed, prior to the dissection, that they have the option of discussing
        individual concerns about dissection with the appropriate teacher.
   Upon completion of the dissection, the remains will be appropriately disposed of as
        recommended by the local board of public health.
   The science courses that include dissection also offer dissection alternatives. Upon written
   request of a student’s parent or guardian, our school will permit a student who objects to
   dissection activities to demonstrate competency through an alternative method.
   Currently, our school offers the following courses that include dissection: (name courses, such
   as: Biology, Honors Biology, and Anatomy and Physiology). Specific dissection and dissection
   alternative activities will be listed on the course syllabi, available to students before enrolling in
   these courses.
   Alternative activities may include models (name models) and applications (name Internet,
   computer, or mobile device programs) in place of dissecting (name organism[s]).
   (Schools may find it easier to provide a chart such as the one below.)

Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                            190


The procedure for a student to participate in an alternative activity in place of dissection is as
follows:
         •    The student will notify the science teacher of the student’s choice to participate in an
              alternative activity in place of participating in a dissection.
         •    The student will submit a written request from his or her parent/legal guardian to the
              science teacher or to the school principal.
         •    The student will be provided an alternative activity to be determined by the teacher,
              who will specify in writing what is expected of the student. Alternative activities will
              allow students to gain the same content knowledge as the dissection activities and will
              require a comparable investment of time and effort by the student.
         •    The student will accept responsibility for completing the alternative activity within the
              assigned time and is expected to learn the same content knowledge as if the student
              were performing the dissection activity.
         •    The student will be subject to the same course standards and examinations as other
              students in the course.
This policy is included in the student handbook and is also provided at the beginning of each school
year to all teachers of science courses that involve dissection.

   Dear _____________________________(Principal or Teacher):
   I understand that participation in hands-on science is important to learning science and that
   dissections are an important component of comprehensive science and life science education. I
   also understand that alternatives to dissection are available and that, upon written request of a
   parent/legal guardian, the school will permit a student to demonstrate competency through an
   alternative method, such as computer simulations and other appropriate research activities. I
   further understand that students participating in alternative activities instead of dissection are
   subject to the same course standards and examinations as other students in the course.
   I request that my child, ____________________________________, be permitted to
   demonstrate competency through alternative activities rather than participating in dissection.
   Sincerely,
   ________________________________

Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Science and Technology / Engineering                         192


The Development of Massachusetts’ Science and
Technology/Engineering Frameworks Since 1995
This Massachusetts Science and Technology/Engineering Curriculum Framework is one of seven curriculum
frameworks that advance Massachusetts’ educational reform in learning, teaching, and assessment. It was
created, and revised several times, with the guidance and input of many educators, including teachers and
administrators in pre-kindergarten through grade 12 school districts, college and university professors,
engineers and scientists in the various domains, and staff from the Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education. This section provides a brief overview of the development of the Framework over
time.
Development of the Standards
1995: Initial Framework
This Framework has its origins in two reform initiatives in Massachusetts: the Education Reform Act of 1993
and Partnerships Advancing the Learning of Mathematics and Science (PALMS). The 1993 legislation
provided for the establishment of the initial Science and Technology Framework and was part of a process to
develop frameworks for all academic subjects. From 1992 to 2002, the PALMS Statewide Systemic Initiative
was funded by the National Science Foundation in partnership with the state and the Noyce Foundation. A
central goal of these initiatives was to develop, disseminate, and implement curriculum frameworks in
science and technology as well as in mathematics. The initial Science and Technology Curriculum Framework
was approved in 1995 and included standards for inquiry and content and grade spans through high school.
2001: Full Revision of the Framework
Because the Education Reform Act requires that frameworks be reviewed and revised periodically, a revision
panel was appointed by the Commissioner and the Board of Education in the summer of 1998. The panel
examined the standards in the original Science and Technology Curriculum Framework, reviewed comments
on them from the field including significant input from educators, and re-assessed their appropriateness in
order to devise a more coherent organization of concepts and skills through the grade levels. The panel
referred to the Benchmarks for Science Literacy—Project 2061 (AAAS, 1993), data from the Third
International Mathematics and Science Study, the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996), the
Technology for All Americans Project (ITEA, 1996), results from the 1998 administration of the MCAS Science
and Technology tests, and advances in STE.
This version of the Framework, for the first time, articulated standards for full-year high school courses in
earth and space science, biology, chemistry, introductory physics, and technology/engineering. The
Framework identified a subset of “core” standards for each course that was designed to serve as the basis
for high school MCAS assessments. This Framework also reflected a strong emphasis on engineering and the
technological systems upon which our society relies. It emphasized the importance of content, removing
inquiry from the standards. This version of the Framework was approved in May 2001.

2006: Minor Revision of High School Standards and Framework Update
The revision of the high school standards in 2006 was undertaken in preparation for the inclusion of STE in
the state’s Competency Determination policy. In particular, the revised content standards presented a single
list of content standards for each course with no differentiation between core and non-core standards,
making all standards subject to local and state assessment. Also, a two-year integrated science course in
grades 9 and 10 was eliminated. No changes were made to standards for pre-K through grade 8.
A number of updates to the Framework were also made at the time. Several Guiding Principles were revised,
including additions regarding literacy, high expectations, assessment, and districtwide planning. An appendix
was added to relate learning standards across all grade spans to broad topics within each strand. Safety
practices and legal regulations were researched and detailed. Also, a second appendix presented the
Department of Education’s (October 2005) Alternative Dissection Policy and resources (see Appendix XII).
2016: Full Revision of the Framework
In the spring of 2009, Massachusetts started a new revision process. After convening a review panel and
reviewing current research, assessment information, and resources, the review panel worked to develop a
revision of the STE standards. In July 2011, the National Research Council released the Framework for K–12
Science Education (NRC, 2012), a critical first step to the development of the Next Generation Science
Standards (NGSS). The NRC Framework reflected the most current research on science and student learning
of science and it identified the science all K–12 students should know from the perspective of scientists and
engineers and the educational research community. Massachusetts joined 26 states to develop the NGSS
using the NRC Framework as a key resource. Educators from across Massachusetts contributed to public
comment during NGSS development, which was released in April 2013. The NGSS and our initial state
revision had much in common in terms of structure and key features, but not enough (based on public
input) to justify Massachusetts’ adoption of the NGSS. Instead, the review panel helped adapt NGSS to meet
the needs and expectations of our state. The key features of these standards are outlined in earlier sections
of this Framework; key features include the integration of science and engineering practices with core ideas,
presentation of grade-by-grade standards for pre-K through grade 8, maintenance of introductory high
school course options, and increased coherence through progressions of learning across grades. The draft
revised standards were made public in December 2013, but not advanced for adoption; this gave districts
time to work on several other major change initiatives undertaken in the state’s Race to the Top grant. This
version of the STE Framework was adopted in January 2016.
