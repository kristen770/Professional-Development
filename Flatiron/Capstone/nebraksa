                12.3.4.a Identify different types of adaptations necessary for survival (morphological, physiological,
                          behavioral)
      Biological Evolution
                12.3.4.b Recognize that the concept of biological evolution is a theory which explains the consequence of
                          the interactions of: (1) the potential for a species to increase its numbers, (2) the genetic
                          variability of offspring due to mutation and recombination of genes, (3) a finite supply of the
                          resources required for life, and (4) the ensuing selection by the environment of those offspring
                          better able to survive and leave offspring
                12.3.4.c Explain how natural selection provides a scientific explanation of the fossil record and the
                          molecular similarities among the diverse species of living organisms
                12.3.4.d Apply the theory of biological evolution to explain diversity of life over time
SC 4: EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCES
Students will integrate and communicate the information, concepts, principles, processes, theories, and models of Earth and
Space Sciences to make connections with the natural and engineered world.
4.1.  Earth in Space
      12.4.1 Students will investigate and describe the known universe.
      Objects in the Sky and Universe
                12.4.1.a Describe the formation of the universe using the Big Bang Theory
                12.4.1.b Recognize that stars, like the Sun, transform matter into energy by nuclear reactions which leads
                          to the formation of other elements
                12.4.1.c Describe stellar evolution
4.2.  Earth Structures and Processes
      12.4.2 Students will investigate the relationships among Earth’s structure, systems, and processes.
      Properties of Earth Materials
                12.4.2.a Recognize how Earth materials move through geochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen)
                          resulting in chemical and physical changes in matter
      Earth’s Processes
                12.4.2.b Describe how heat convection in the mantle propels the plates comprising Earth’s surface across
                          the face of the globe (plate tectonics)
      Use of Earth Materials
                12.4.2.c Evaluate the impact of human activity and natural causes on Earth’s resources (groundwater,
                          rivers, land, fossil fuels)
4.3.  Energy in Earth’s Systems
      12.4.3 Students will investigate and describe the relationships among the sources of energy and their effects on
                Earth’s systems.
      Energy Sources
                12.4.3.a Describe how radiation, conduction, and convection transfer heat in Earth’s systems
                12.4.3.b Identify internal and external sources of heat energy in Earth’s systems
                12.4.3.c Compare and contrast benefits of renewable and nonrenewable energy sources
      Weather and Climate
                12.4.3.d Describe natural influences (Earth’s rotation, mountain ranges, oceans, differential heating) on
                          global climate

      12.4.4 Students will explain the history and evolution of Earth.
      Past/Present Earth
              12.4.4.a Recognize that in any sequence of sediments or rocks that has not been overturned, the youngest
                         sediments or rocks are at the top of the sequence and the oldest are at the bottom (law of
                         superposition)
              12.4.4.b Interpret Earth’s history by observing rock sequences, using fossils to correlate the sequences at
                         various locations, and using data from radioactive dating methods
              12.4.4.c Compare and contrast the physical and biological differences of the early Earth with the planet
                         we live on today
