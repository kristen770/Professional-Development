             DIRECTIONS
             There are 35 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by four choices,
             numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the correct
             answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
             question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have cho-
             sen.
             Read the sample question below:
                                                   Sample Question
                                           Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
             The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look
             at the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice num-
             ber 2 is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has
             been filled in.
             Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
             question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
             Then mark the answer you want.
             You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out
             your answers to the questions.
             You may use a calculator if needed.
             When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work care-
             fully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
             When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II.

                 Manatees are mammals that live in the warm, clear water environment of Florida’s shal-
             low rivers. They are large, peaceful, gentle, curious creatures and slow-moving swimmers.
             They spend many hours each day feeding on water plants. Manatees must surface to
             breathe every 15 minutes.
                 The manatee’s environment is changing because of hotels and homes being built along
             Florida’s rivers, and the change is affecting them in a negative way. Noise and activity from
             people and boats scare them. Manatees can be seriously injured by powerboat propellers
             because the manatees cannot tell the direction from which the boats are coming. The
             water plants the manatees use for food are being destroyed. As a result of these and other
             changes in their surroundings, manatees are on the endangered species list and may one
             day be gone from Florida’s rivers.

             DIRECTIONS
             There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by four choices,
             numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the correct
             answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
             question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have cho-
             sen.
             Read the sample question below:
                                                   Sample Question
                                           Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
             The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look
             at the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice num-
             ber 2 is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has
             been filled in.
             Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
             question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
             Then mark the answer you want.
             You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out
             your answers to the questions.
             You may use a calculator if needed.
             When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work care-
             fully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
             When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II.

             DIRECTIONS
             There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by four choices,
             numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the correct
             answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
             question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have cho-
             sen.
             Read the sample question below:
                                                   Sample Question
                                           Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
             The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look
             at the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice num-
             ber 2 is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has
             been filled in.
             Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
             question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
             Then mark the answer you want.
             You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out
             your answers to the questions.
             You may use a calculator if needed.
             When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work care-
             fully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
             When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II.

             DIRECTIONS
             There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by four choices, num-
             bered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the best answer.
             On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each question by
             filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
             Read the sample question below:
                                                    Sample Question
                                              Earth gets most of its light from
                                             (1) the stars
                                             (2) the Sun
                                             (3) the Moon
                                             (4) other planets
             The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
             the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number
             2 is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been
             filled in.
             Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each ques-
             tion. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely. Then
             mark the answer you want.
             You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
             answers to the questions.
             You may use a calculator if needed.
             When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work care-
             fully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
             When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

                                                           Part I
             DIRECTIONS
             There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by four choices, num-
             bered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the best answer.
             On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each question by
             filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
             Read the sample question below:
                                                    Sample Question
                                              Earth gets most of its light from
                                             (1) the stars
                                             (2) the Sun
                                             (3) the Moon
                                             (4) other planets
             The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
             the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number
             2 is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been
             filled in.
             Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each ques-
             tion. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely. Then
             mark the answer you want.
             You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
             answers to the questions.
             You may use a calculator if needed.
             When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work care-
             fully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
             When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

                    A farmer grows and sells flowering plants. The best-selling plants are the ones with
             the most blossoms. The farmer reads an advertisement for a plant food saying that it will
             make plants grow faster and taller. The farmer predicts that taller plants will have more
             blossoms and performs the following experiment to test this hypothesis.
                    Two groups of 10 plants each are grown in identical pots filled with equal amounts of
             identical soil. The amount of sunlight, the room temperature, and the amount of water are
             held constant for both groups. Group A is given plant food at regular intervals according
             to the instructions on the package. Group B is not given plant food.
                    The farmer observes the plants after 15 weeks of growth. The results are recorded below.

                                                       Acid Rain
                    Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are pollutants released into the atmosphere from
             the burning of fossil fuels. These pollutants combine with moisture in the air to form acid
             rain. A main source of these pollutants can be traced to power plants located in the mid-
             western United States. Due to weather patterns, the effects of acid rain have been most
             severe in the northeastern United States, including New York State.
                    The acid rain destroys the natural balance in lakes and streams and kills many species
             of fish. Acidic conditions affect not only lakes and forests, but also buildings and statues
             composed of limestone and marble. Other materials, such as metals, ceramics, glass,
             paints, and leather, are affected by acid rain.

             DIRECTIONS
             There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by three or four
             choices, numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the
             best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
             question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
             Read the sample question below:
                                                    Sample Question
                                             Earth gets most of its light from
                                            (1)  the stars
                                            (2)  the Sun
                                            (3)  the Moon
                                            (4)  other planets
             The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
             the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number
             2 is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been
             filled in.
             Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each ques-
             tion. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely. Then
             mark the answer you want.
             You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
             answers to the questions.
             You may use a calculator if needed.
             When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work care-
             fully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
             When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

45 A student wanted to study the amount of mold growing on pizza at different temperatures. In the exper-
     iment, the student set up four identical pans of pizza. Each pan contained the same amount of pizza. The
     temperatures and light conditions are shown in the data table below.

48 A student made this entry in her laboratory notebook:
     5/5/2005
                  We are doing an experiment to determine if the size of soil particles affects the amount
              of water that flows through soil. We poured 100 milliliters (mL) of water through four dif-
              ferent types of soil. The equipment is shown below.
                                      Beaker of water
                                                                       Soil
                                                                       Water flowing
                                                                       from the soil
                                                                       Graduated
                                                                       cylinder

                 We got the following results: With gray soil, the average particle size was 2.0 millimeters (mm)
             and 80 mL of water flowed through. We then used tan soil. Its average particle size was 0.5 mm
             and 40 mL of water flowed through. With brown soil, 60 mL of water flowed through. Brown
             soil has an average particle size of 1.5 mm. In our last trial we used black soil. It has an
             average particle size of 1.0 mm and 50 mL of water flowed through.
     a Using the data table below, organize the results to show the average particle size and the amount of
        water that flowed through for each type of soil. Be sure to include column headings, data, and units in
        the table. [3]

     Base your answers to questions 57 and 58 on the diagram below and on your knowledge of science. The
diagram shows a set of materials that a science teacher used to demonstrate motion. The rubber band has
been stretched with a string that has been tied to the nail. A weight is resting on the platform. The platform
is resting on several round pencils on a tabletop.

                                               Preserved in Amber
                  Sap is a substance secreted by some trees. Many years ago, plants and small animals
              were caught in the sap on the trees. Sap hardens and turns into a clear substance called
              amber. The plants or animals are preserved as fossils in the amber. Part of a plant pre-
              served in amber is shown below.

             DIRECTIONS
             There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by three or four
             choices, numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the
             best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
             question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
             Read the sample question below:
                                                    Sample Question
                                             Earth gets most of its light from
                                            (1)  the stars
                                            (2)  the Sun
                                            (3)  the Moon
                                            (4)  other planets
             The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
             the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number
             2 is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been
             filled in.
             Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each ques-
             tion. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely. Then
             mark the answer you want.
             You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
             answers to the questions.
             You may use a calculator if needed.
             When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work care-
             fully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
             When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

    Base your answers to questions 43 and 44 on the information and graphs below and on your knowledge of
science.
               Some species of bacteria are harmful. Antibiotics are chemicals that kill bacteria. Some
          bacteria are resistant to antibiotics and are not killed by these chemicals. Over time, the
          resistant bacteria can reproduce and create populations that are not affected by antibiotics.
               The graphs below show the results of a controlled experiment that measured the
          population of one species of bacteria that had been grown in four containers under identical
          conditions. Different antibiotics were added to three of the four containers.

                    A student adds sugar to a cup of iced tea and a cup of hot tea. She notices that the time
             needed for the sugar to dissolve in each cup is different. She thinks this has something to do
             with the temperature of the tea. She wants to design an experiment to see if she is
             correct.

             DIRECTIONS
             There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by three or four
             choices, numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the
             best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
             question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
             Read the sample question below.
                                                    Sample Question
                                             Earth gets most of its light from
                                            (1)  the stars
                                            (2)  the Sun
                                            (3)  the Moon
                                            (4)  other planets
             The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
             the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2
             is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been filled
             in.
             Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each ques-
             tion. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely. Then
             mark the answer you want.
             You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
             answers to the questions.
             You may use a calculator if needed.
             When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work care-
             fully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
             When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

          Base your answers to questions 50 and 51 on the information about blood groups below.
                  Human blood is classified into four blood types: A, B, AB, and O. An offspring’s blood
              type is determined by genes passed on from the offspring’s parents. Each parent gives an off-
              spring one gene for blood type. The combination of the two genes determines the offspring’s
              blood type.
                  There are three genes, A, B, and o, that are responsible for the four blood types. The
              table below shows how these three genes interact to produce the four blood types.

            DIRECTIONS
            There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by three or four
            choices, numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the
            best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
            question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
            Read the sample question below.
                                                   Sample Question
                                            Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
            The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
            the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2
            is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been filled
            in.
            Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
            question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
            Then mark the answer you want.
            You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
            answers to the questions.
            You may use a calculator if needed.
            When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work care-
            fully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
            When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

               During an experiment, a strip of magnesium (Mg) metal wrapped around a nichrome
         (nonreactive) wire is placed in a flask. The nichrome wire outside the flask is insulated. The con-
         tents of the flask are sealed off from the environment with a rubber stopper. When the nichrome
         wire is connected to a battery, an electric current passes through the wire, causing a white pow-
         der called magnesium oxide (MgO) to form.

                                                 Gems and Minerals
                     There are about 4,000 types of minerals on Earth. Of these, only about 15 are
                 used to make gems. Gems are minerals that may have been cut and polished to
                 make them sparkle.
                     The diamond is the hardest natural substance we know. Diamonds form deep
                 under ground at very high temperatures and pressure conditions caused by the
                 overlying thick layers of rock that squeeze the carbon atoms into a tight, strong
                 crystal.
                     Diamonds might grow under these conditions for 1 billion to 3 billion years and
                therefore are considered the oldest gemstone. Only about 20 percent of diamonds
                are made into jewels. Because they are so hard, most diamonds are used to make
                tools such as dental drills and metal cutters.

                                          Inheritance of Color Blindness
                        Gender in humans is determined by a pair of sex chromosomes. A female has
                  two X chromosomes and a male has one X and one Y chromosome. A recessive gene
                  that causes color blindness is located on the X chromosome. When a male inherits
                  this gene, he will be color-blind because the Y chromosome does not contain a gene
                  for color blindness.
                         In order for a female to be color-blind, she must inherit the recessive gene on
                  both X chromosomes. If she has the gene on only one chromosome, she is not color-
                  blind. She is called a carrier because she can pass this gene along to her
                  offspring. The pedigree chart shows the children and grandchildren of a female
                  carrier and a male who is not color-blind.

                        and inferences about a rock sample collected on a field trip. The student wrote
                        the nine statements below.
                        1. The rock is mostly gray with white speckles on the outside surface.
                        2. When acid is placed on the rock, a bubbling reaction occurs at the white speckles.
                        3. The white speckles are probably the mineral calcite.
                        4. The rock probably formed in a water environment.
                        5. The rock measures 4 cm wide, 8 cm long, and 2 cm thick.
                        6. Fossil shells embedded in the rock can be seen with a hand lens.
                        7. If the rock is broken with a hammer, it will probably contain more fossil shells
                           within its interior.
                        8. The rock has a smooth surface.
                        9. The smooth surface is most likely the result of weathering and erosion over
                            many years.

    Base your answers to questions 82 and 83 on the information below and on your knowledge of science.
                     An experiment was done to study the amount of capillary action that occurs in a
                 certain type of paper towel. Capillary action is the upward movement of liquid
                 through tiny spaces. A strip of paper towel was held with one end in a glass of water.
                 The water height in the towel was recorded every five seconds. Three trials were done
                 using the same type of towel. The diagram shows the experimental setup and the data
                 table shows the results of the experiment.

            DIRECTIONS
            There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by three or four
            choices, numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the
            best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
            question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
            Read the sample question below.
                                                   Sample Question
                                            Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
            The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
            the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2
            is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been filled
            in.
            Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
            question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
            Then mark the answer you want.
            You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
            answers to the questions.
            You may use a calculator if needed.
            When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work care-
            fully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
            When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

    Three different investigations to determine the period of a swinging pendulum are described below.
    • In investigation 1, the pendulum was released at different angles. The length of string and mass of the
       ball were the same for each angle.
    •In investigation 2, different lengths of string were used. The angle of release and mass of the ball were
      the same for each length.
    •In investigation 3, balls of different masses were used. The angle of release and length of string were
      the same for each mass.
    The data tables below show the results of the three investigations.

            DIRECTIONS
            There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by three or four
            choices, numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the
            best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
            question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
            Read the sample question below.
                                                   Sample Question
                                            Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
            The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
            the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2
            is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been filled
            in.
            Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
            question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
            Then mark the answer you want.
            You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
            answers to the questions.
            You may use a calculator if needed.
            When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work
            carefully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
            When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

            DIRECTIONS
            There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by three or four
            choices, numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the
            best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
            question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
            Read the sample question below.
                                                   Sample Question
                                            Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
            The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
            the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2
            is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been filled
            in.
            Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
            question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
            Then mark the answer you want.
            You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
            answers to the questions.
            You may use a calculator if needed.
            When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work
            carefully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
            When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

            DIRECTIONS
            There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by three or four
            choices, numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the
            best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
            question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
            Read the sample question below.
                                                   Sample Question
                                            Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
            The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
            the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2
            is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been filled
            in.
            Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
            question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
            Then mark the answer you want.
            You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
            answers to the questions.
            You may use a calculator if needed.
            When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work
            carefully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
            When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

    Base your answers to questions 51 and 52 on the information and data table below and on your knowledge
of science. The data table lists the average cumulative loss in thickness of glaciers around the world from 1980
to 2005.
                                          Earth’s Shrinking Glaciers
              Scientists measure the thickness of glaciers to determine the effect that warmer
         temperatures have on Earth. During the last few decades, glaciers around the world have
         decreased in size. The data table lists the average cumulative loss in the thickness of glaciers
         in nine regions of Earth for the years shown. Cumulative means that the amount of loss for
         each year is added to all the previous years. Glacial thickness is measured in meters (m).

            DIRECTIONS
            There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by four choices,
            numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the
            best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
            question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
            Read the sample question below.
                                                   Sample Question
                                            Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
            The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
            the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2
            is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been filled
            in.
            Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
            question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
            Then mark the answer you want.
            You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
            answers to the questions.
            You may use a calculator if needed.
            When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work
            carefully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
            When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

             A group of students conducted an experiment to test the hypothesis that radish plants
         watered with acidic rainwater would not be as tall as radish plants watered with nonacidic
         rainwater. The students planted two identical radish seeds in equal amounts of soil. One was
         watered with nonacidic rainwater, and the other was watered with an equal amount of acidic
         rainwater. All other variables that would affect plant growth were the same for both plants.
         The students measured the heights of the plants in centimeters (cm). The height of the plant

            DIRECTIONS
            There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by four choices,
            numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the
            best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
            question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
            Read the sample question below.
                                                   Sample Question
                                            Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
            The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
            the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2
            is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been filled
            in.
            Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
            question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
            Then mark the answer you want.
            You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
            answers to the questions.
            You may use a calculator if needed.
            When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work
            carefully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
            When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

               The student pulled the cart across the table five times. Each time, the student used more
         force. Force is measured in newtons (N) on the spring scale. The student then
         calculated the acceleration of the cart, measured in meters per second squared (m/s2). The
         results are shown in the data table.

              A group of science students have been learning how the human circulatory system reacts
         during exercise. The students measured their heart rates both before and after they ran five
         laps around the school gym. This was repeated two more times, with a 5-minute rest period
         between each trial. The average heart rates of the students are shown in the bar graph.

               A group of students investigated how the length of a column of air inside a test tube
         affects the pitch of a sound produced by blowing across the top of the test tube. Pitch refers
         to how high or low a sound is. The length of the air column was varied by pouring different
         amounts of water into five test tubes. The pitch produced by each test tube was ranked on a
         scale of 1–5, with 1 being the lowest pitch and 5 being the highest pitch. The results of the
         investigation are shown in the data table below.

            DIRECTIONS
            There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by three or four
            choices, numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the
            best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
            question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
            Read the sample question below.
                                                   Sample Question
                                            Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
            The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
            the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2
            is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been filled
            in.
            Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
            question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
            Then mark the answer you want.
            You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
            answers to the questions.
            You may use a calculator if needed.
            When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work
            carefully and answer all of the questions in Part I.
            When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

    made each time flooding occurs. The results will
    be compared after six months.
    Which hypothesis is being tested in this
    experiment?
    (1) Soil erosion is affected by the strength of the
          wind.
    (2) Flooded areas have greater soil erosion than
          areas that are not flooded.
    (3) Some types of plants reduce soil erosion
          more than others.
    (4) Some types of soil are more easily eroded.

    Base your answers to questions 47 through 49 on the information below and on your knowledge of
science. The diagram represents a pendulum, which is a weight attached by a string to a fixed point and
allowed to swing freely back and forth. A group of students did an experiment in which they timed, in
seconds (s), how long it took for the pendulum to complete one swing (back and forth) for five different string
lengths. The results are shown in the data table.

               A student was interested in comparing sunblock lotions, which contain chemicals that
         protect the skin from sunburn. The student purchased three different brands of lotion at
         three different prices and performed an experiment to see which one best protected the skin.
         The lotions cost $3, $5, and $7 for an 8-ounce bottle. The sun protection factor (SPF) was 30
         for all three lotions. The student applied equal amounts of each lotion next to each other on
         one of her arms. The three areas covered by the lotions were the same size. The student

              Genes control the inheritance of traits. Some genes are dominant and some are
         recessive. Some are neither dominant nor recessive, such as the genes that control flower
         color in a certain species of plant. In this species, a plant with red flowers inherits two genes
         for red (RR), a plant with white flowers inherits two genes for white (WW), and a plant with
         pink flowers inherits one gene for red and one gene for white (RW).
61 The Punnet square below shows the results of a cross between a plant with red flowers and a plant with

            DIRECTIONS
            There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by four choices,
            numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the
            best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
            question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
            Read the sample question below.
                                                   Sample Question
                                            Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
            The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
            the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2
            is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been filled
            in.
            Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
            question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
            Then mark the answer you want.
            You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
            answers to the questions.
            You may use a calculator if needed.
            When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work carefully
            and answer all of the questions in Part I.
            When you have finished Part I, go right on to Part II. Answer all of the questions in Part II.

of science.
                   The diagram shows two variations of the same species of peppered moth resting
            on a tree. Originally, most peppered moths were light-colored and blended in with the
            light-colored bark of the trees in their environment. Due to pollution during the Industrial
            Revolution, the trees became blackened by soot. As a result, the population of light-colored
            moths decreased, due to predators. At the same time, the population of dark-colored moths
            increased, because they were less visible to predators.

science.
                 An antibiotic is a drug prescribed to people who are sick due to a bacterial infection.
           Streptococcus bacteria may cause a throat infection in humans. An experiment was designed
           to test the effects of two different antibiotics, A and B, on samples of Streptococcus bacteria.
           The graphs below show the results of this experiment.

                   A student dissolved a 40-gram block of a salt in 100 grams of warm water at 45°C.
            The solution was allowed to cool down to 24°C. The student noticed that some of the salt
            came out of the solution and settled to the bottom of the beaker. It is later determined that
            12 grams of the salt came out of the solution.
51 How many grams of the salt were dissolved in the solution at 24°C? [1]

    Base your answers to questions 82 and 83 on the diagram below and on your knowledge of science. The
diagram represents the steps necessary to provide electricity to area homes. In a power facility, coal is burned
to produce heat energy to boil water. The steam produced is used to power the generator, which produces
electricity.
                                                                                         Homes

            DIRECTIONS
            There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by three or four
            choices, numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the
            best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each
            question by filling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.
            Read the sample question below.
                                                   Sample Question
                                            Earth gets most of its light from
                                           (1)  the stars
                                           (2)  the Sun
                                           (3)  the Moon
                                           (4)  other planets
            The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at
            the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2
            is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been filled
            in.
            Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each
            question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your first mark completely.
            Then mark the answer you want.
            You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
            answers to the questions.
            You may use a calculator if needed.
            When you are told to start working, turn the page and begin with question 1. Work carefully

                   Goldfish are one of the most common fish kept in a home aquarium. One thing these
            fish need is an appropriately sized environment. Goldfish produce a hormone, known as
            somatostatin, that can limit their growth and can keep them from outgrowing their tank.
            Somatostatin allows the fish to grow to an appropriate size so that the concentration of
            wastes produced by the fish do not reach harmful levels in the aquarium.

    Base your answers to questions 79 through 81 on the passage below and on your knowledge of science.
The passage describes some of the properties of earthquake waves.
                                             Earthquake Waves
                   An earthquake occurs when pieces of Earth’s crust move, producing waves of energy
            called seismic waves. Two types of seismic waves that travel through Earth’s interior are
            called P-waves and S-waves. P-waves can travel through solids and liquids, but S-waves can
            only travel through solids.
79 Identify one Earth layer in which earthquakes may occur. [1]
80 Explain how the properties of P-waves and S-waves have been used to determine that Earth’s outer core is
    liquid. [1]
81 Other than moving to a new area, describe two actions people should take in order to prepare for
    the possibility of strong earthquakes. [1]

    Base your answers to questions 84 and 85 on the passage and data table below and on your knowledge of
science.
                   A group of students were experimenting with building electromagnets in science class.
            To do this, the students wrapped a piece of insulated copper wire around an iron nail and
            then connected the two ends of the wire to a battery, making the nail magnetic. The number
            of wraps of the wire around the nail affected the number of metal paperclips that the elec-
            tromagnet could pick up at one time. The results of the students’ experiment are shown in
            the data table below.

84 Predict how many paperclips the electromagnet would have picked up if the students had wrapped the
    wire around the nail only five times. [1]
                                   paperclips
85 When the wires were disconnected from the battery, all of the paper clips fell off the nail. Explain why
    the battery is needed to pick up the paperclips. [1]
