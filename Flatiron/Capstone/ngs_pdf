    Topic Arrangements of the Next Generation Science Standards
At the beginning of the NGSS development process, in order to eliminate potential redundancy, seek an
appropriate grain size, and seek natural connections among the Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs) identified
within the Framework for K-12 Science Education, the writers arranged the DCIs into topics around which
to develop the standards. This structure provided the original basis of the standards, and is preferred by
many states. However, the coding structure of individual performance expectations reflects
the DCI arrangement in the Framework.
Due to the fact that the NGSS progress toward end-of-high school core ideas, the standards may be
rearranged in any order within a grade level.

                                      Elementary Standards
Students in kindergarten through fifth grade begin to develop an understanding of the four
disciplinary core ideas: physical sciences; life sciences; earth and space sciences; and
engineering, technology, and applications of science. In the earlier grades, students begin by
recognizing patterns and formulating answers to questions about the world around them. By
the end of fifth grade, students are able to demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency in
gathering, describing, and using information about the natural and designed world(s). The
performance expectations in elementary school grade bands develop ideas and skills that will
allow students to explain more complex phenomena in the four disciplines as they progress to
middle school and high school. While the performance expectations shown in kindergarten
through fifth grade couple particular practices with specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional
decisions should include use of many practices that lead to the performance expectations.

                                           Kindergarten
The performance expectations in kindergarten help students formulate answers to questions
such as: “What happens if you push or pull an object harder? Where do animals live and why
do they live there? What is the weather like today and how is it different from yesterday?”
Kindergarten performance expectations include PS2, PS3, LS1, ESS2, ESS3, and ETS1
Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework. Students are expected to develop
understanding of patterns and variations in local weather and the purpose of weather
forecasting to prepare for, and respond to, severe weather. Students are able to apply an
understanding of the effects of different strengths or different directions of pushes and pulls on
the motion of an object to analyze a design solution. Students are also expected to develop
understanding of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive and the
relationship between their needs and where they live. The crosscutting concepts of patterns;
cause and effect; systems and system models; interdependence of science, engineering, and
technology; and influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural
world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the kindergarten
performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency
in asking questions, developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations,
analyzing and interpreting data, designing solutions, engaging in argument from evidence, and
obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. Students are expected to use these
practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

K.Forces and Interactions: Pushes and Pulls
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
   K-PS2-1. Plan and conduct an investigation to compare the effects of different strengths or different directions of pushes
                    and pulls on the motion of an object. [Clarification Statement: Examples of pushes or pulls could include a string attached to an object being pulled,
                    a person pushing an object, a person stopping a rolling ball, and two objects colliding and pushing on each other.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to
                    different relative strengths or different directions, but not both at the same time. Assessment does not include non-contact pushes or pulls such as those produced by
                    magnets.]
   K-PS2-2. Analyze data to determine if a design solution works as intended to change the speed or direction of an object
                    with a push or a pull.* [Clarification Statement: Examples of problems requiring a solution could include having a marble or other object move a certain
                    distance, follow a particular path, and knock down other objects. Examples of solutions could include tools such as a ramp to increase the speed of the object and a
                    structure that would cause an object such as a marble or ball to turn.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include friction as a mechanism for change in
                    speed.]

K.Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems: Animals, Plants, and Their Environment
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
  K-LS1-1. Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.                                                           [Clarification
                   Statement: Examples of patterns could include that animals need to take in food but plants do not; the different kinds of food needed by different types of animals;
                   the requirement of plants to have light; and that all living things need water.]
  K-ESS2-2. Construct an argument supported by evidence for how plants and animals (including humans) can change the
                   environment to meet their needs. [Clarification Statement: Examples of plants and animals changing their environment could include a squirrel digs
                   in the ground to hide its food and tree roots can break concrete.]
  K-ESS3-1. Use a model to represent the relationship between the needs of different plants or animals (including humans)
                   and the places they live. [Clarification Statement: Examples of relationships could include that deer eat buds and leaves, therefore, they usually live in
                   forested areas, and grasses need sunlight so they often grow in meadows. Plants, animals, and their surroundings make up a system.]
  K-ESS3-3. Communicate solutions that will reduce the impact of humans on the land, water, air, and/or other living things
                   in the local environment.* [Clarification Statement: Examples of human impact on the land could include cutting trees to produce paper and using
                   resources to produce bottles. Examples of solutions could include reusing paper and recycling cans and bottles.]

                                               First Grade
The performance expectations in first grade help students formulate answers to questions such
as: “What happens when materials vibrate? What happens when there is no light? What are
some ways plants and animals meet their needs so that they can survive and grow? How are
parents and their children similar and different? What objects are in the sky and how do they
seem to move?” First grade performance expectations include PS4, LS1, LS3, and ESS1
Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework. Students are expected to develop
understanding of the relationship between sound and vibrating materials as well as between the
availability of light and ability to see objects. The idea that light travels from place to place can
be understood by students at this level through determining the effect of placing objects made
with different materials in the path of a beam of light. Students are also expected to develop
understanding of how plants and animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow,
and meet their needs as well as how behaviors of parents and offspring help the offspring
survive. The understanding is developed that young plants and animals are like, but not exactly
the same as, their parents. Students are able to observe, describe, and predict some patterns of
the movement of objects in the sky. The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect;
structure and function; and influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and
the natural world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the
first grade performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-appropriate
proficiency in planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting data,
constructing explanations and designing solutions, and obtaining, evaluating, and
communicating information. Students are expected to use these practices to demonstrate
understanding of the core ideas.

                                          Second Grade
The performance expectations in second grade help students formulate answers to questions
such as: “How does land change and what are some things that cause it to change? What are
the different kinds of land and bodies of water? How are materials similar and different from
one another, and how do the properties of the materials relate to their use? What do plants
need to grow? How many types of living things live in a place?” Second grade performance
expectations include PS1, LS2, LS4, ESS1, ESS2, and ETS1 Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC
Framework. Students are expected to develop an understanding of what plants need to grow
and how plants depend on animals for seed dispersal and pollination. Students are also
expected to compare the diversity of life in different habitats. An understanding of observable
properties of materials is developed by students at this level through analysis and classification
of different materials. Students are able to apply their understanding of the idea that wind and
water can change the shape of the land to compare design solutions to slow or prevent such
change. Students are able to use information and models to identify and represent the shapes
and kinds of land and bodies of water in an area and where water is found on Earth. The
crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; energy and matter; structure and function;
stability and change; and influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the
natural world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the
second grade performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-
appropriate proficiency in developing and using models, planning and carrying out
investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, constructing explanations and designing
solutions, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating
information. Students are expected to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the
core ideas.

                   small objects.]
    2-PS1-4. Construct an argument with evidence that some changes caused by heating or cooling can be reversed and some
                   cannot. [Clarification Statement: Examples of reversible changes could include materials such as water and butter at different temperatures. Examples of
                   irreversible changes could include cooking an egg, freezing a plant leaf, and heating paper.]

                                           Third Grade
The performance expectations in third grade help students formulate answers to questions such
as: “What is typical weather in different parts of the world and during different times of the
year? How can the impact of weather-related hazards be reduced? How do organisms vary in
their traits? How are plants, animals, and environments of the past similar or different from
current plants, animals, and environments? What happens to organisms when their
environment changes? How do equal and unequal forces on an object affect the object? How
can magnets be used?” Third grade performance expectations include PS2, LS1, LS2, LS3, LS4,
ESS2, and ESS3 Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework. Students are able to organize
and use data to describe typical weather conditions expected during a particular season. By
applying their understanding of weather-related hazards, students are able to make a claim
about the merit of a design solution that reduces the impacts of such hazards. Students are
expected to develop an understanding of the similarities and differences of organisms’ life
cycles. An understanding that organisms have different inherited traits, and that the
environment can also affect the traits that an organism develops, is acquired by students at this
level. In addition, students are able to construct an explanation using evidence for how the
variations in characteristics among individuals of the same species may provide advantages in
surviving, finding mates, and reproducing. Students are expected to develop an understanding
of types of organisms that lived long ago and also about the nature of their environments. Third
graders are expected to develop an understanding of the idea that when the environment
changes some organisms survive and reproduce, some move to new locations, some move into
the transformed environment, and some die. Students are able to determine the effects of
balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object and the cause and effect
relationships of electric or magnetic interactions between two objects not in contact with each
other. They are then able to apply their understanding of magnetic interactions to define a
simple design problem that can be solved with magnets. The crosscutting concepts of patterns;
cause and effect; scale, proportion, and quantity; systems and system models; interdependence
of science, engineering, and technology; and influence of engineering, technology, and science
on society and the natural world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core
ideas. In the third grade performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate
grade-appropriate proficiency in asking questions and defining problems; developing and using
models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, constructing
explanations and designing solutions, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining,
evaluating, and communicating information. Students are expected to use these practices to
demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

3.Forces and Interactions
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
   3-PS2-1. Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the
                    motion of an object. [Clarification Statement: Examples could include an unbalanced force on one side of a ball can make it start moving; and, balanced
                    forces pushing on a box from both sides will not produce any motion at all.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to one variable at a time: number, size,
                    or direction of forces. Assessment does not include quantitative force size, only qualitative and relative. Assessment is limited to gravity being addressed as a force
                    that pulls objects down.]
   3-PS2-2.         Make observations and/or measurements of an object’s motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to
                    predict future motion. [Clarification Statement: Examples of motion with a predictable pattern could include a child swinging in a swing, a ball rolling
                    back and forth in a bowl, and two children on a see-saw.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include technical terms such as period and frequency.]
   3-PS2-3.         Ask questions to determine cause and effect relationships of electric or magnetic interactions between two
                    objects not in contact with each other. [Clarification Statement: Examples of an electric force could include the force on hair from an electrically
                    charged balloon and the electrical forces between a charged rod and pieces of paper; examples of a magnetic force could include the force between two permanent
                    magnets, the force between an electromagnet and steel paperclips, and the force exerted by one magnet versus the force exerted by two magnets. Examples of
                    cause and effect relationships could include how the distance between objects affects strength of the force and how the orientation of magnets affects the direction
                    of the magnetic force.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to forces produced by objects that can be manipulated by students, and electrical interactions
                    are limited to static electricity.]
   3-PS2-4.         Define a simple design problem that can be solved by applying scientific ideas about magnets.*                                                     [Clarification Statement:
                    Examples of problems could include constructing a latch to keep a door shut and creating a device to keep two moving objects from touching each other.]

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
 3-LS1-1. Develop models to describe that organisms have unique and diverse life cycles but all have in common birth,
                  growth, reproduction, and death. [Clarification Statement: Changes organisms go through during their life form a pattern.] [Assessment Boundary:

 3-LS3-1. Analyze and interpret data to provide evidence that plants and animals have traits inherited from parents and that
                  variation of these traits exists in a group of similar organisms. [Clarification Statement: Patterns are the similarities and differences in
                  traits shared between offspring and their parents, or among siblings. Emphasis is on organisms other than humans.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not
                  include genetic mechanisms of inheritance and prediction of traits. Assessment is limited to non-human examples.]
 3-LS3-2.         Use evidence to support the explanation that traits can be influenced by the environment. [Clarification Statement: Examples
                  of the environment affecting a trait could include normally tall plants grown with insufficient water are stunted; and, a pet dog that is given too much food and little
                  exercise may become overweight.]
 3-LS4-2. Use evidence to construct an explanation for how the variations in characteristics among individuals of the same
                  species may provide advantages in surviving, finding mates, and reproducing. [Clarification Statement: Examples of cause and
                  effect relationships could be plants that have larger thorns than other plants may be less likely to be eaten by predators; and, animals that have better camouflage
                  coloration than other animals may be more likely to survive and therefore more likely to leave offspring.]

                                          Fourth Grade
The performance expectations in fourth grade help students formulate answers to questions
such as: “What are waves and what are some things they can do? How can water, ice, wind
and vegetation change the land? What patterns of Earth’s features can be determined with the
use of maps? How do internal and external structures support the survival, growth, behavior,
and reproduction of plants and animals? What is energy and how is it related to motion? How is
energy transferred? How can energy be used to solve a problem?” Fourth grade performance
expectations include PS3, PS4, LS1, ESS1, ESS2, ESS3, and ETS1 Disciplinary Core Ideas from
the NRC Framework. Students are able to use a model of waves to describe patterns of waves
in terms of amplitude and wavelength, and that waves can cause objects to move. Students are
expected to develop understanding of the effects of weathering or the rate of erosion by water,
ice, wind, or vegetation. They apply their knowledge of natural Earth processes to generate and
compare multiple solutions to reduce the impacts of such processes on humans. In order to
describe patterns of Earth’s features, students analyze and interpret data from maps. Fourth
graders are expected to develop an understanding that plants and animals have internal and
external structures that function to support survival, growth, behavior, and reproduction. By
developing a model, they describe that an object can be seen when light reflected from its
surface enters the eye. Students are able to use evidence to construct an explanation of the
relationship between the speed of an object and the energy of that object. Students are
expected to develop an understanding that energy can be transferred from place to place by
sound, light, heat, and electric currents or from object to object through collisions. They apply
their understanding of energy to design, test, and refine a device that converts energy from one
form to another. The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; energy and matter;
systems and system models; interdependence of science, engineering, and technology; and
influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural world are called
out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the fourth grade performance
expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency in asking
questions, developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing
and interpreting data, constructing explanations and designing solutions, engaging in argument
from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. Students are
expected to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

                    quantitative measurements of energy.]
 4-PS3-4.           Apply scientific ideas to design, test, and refine a device that converts energy from one form to another.* [Clarification
                    Statement: Examples of devices could include electric circuits that convert electrical energy into motion energy of a vehicle, light, or sound; and, a passive solar heater
                    that converts light into heat. Examples of constraints could include the materials, cost, or time to design the device.] [Assessment Boundary: Devices should be limited
                    to those that convert motion energy to electric energy or use stored energy to cause motion or produce light or sound.]
 4-ESS3-1. Obtain and combine information to describe that energy and fuels are derived from natural resources and that their
                    uses affect the environment. [Clarification Statement: Examples of renewable energy resources could include wind energy, water behind dams, and
                    sunlight; non-renewable energy resources are fossil fuels and fissile materials. Examples of environmental effects could include loss of habitat due to dams, loss of
                    habitat due to surface mining, and air pollution from burning of fossil fuels.]

                                           Fifth Grade
The performance expectations in fifth grade help students formulate answers to questions such
as: “When matter changes, does its weight change? How much water can be found in different
places on Earth? Can new substances be created by combining other substances? How does
matter cycle through ecosystems? Where does the energy in food come from and what is it
used for? How do lengths and directions of shadows or relative lengths of day and night change
from day to day, and how does the appearance of some stars change in different seasons?”
Fifth grade performance expectations include PS1, PS2, PS3, LS1, LS2, ESS1, ESS2, and ESS3
Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework. Students are able to describe that matter is
made of particles too small to be seen through the development of a model. Students develop
an understanding of the idea that regardless of the type of change that matter undergoes, the
total weight of matter is conserved. Students determine whether the mixing of two or more
substances results in new substances. Through the development of a model using an example,
students are able to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere
interact. They describe and graph data to provide evidence about the distribution of water on
Earth. Students develop an understanding of the idea that plants get the materials they need
for growth chiefly from air and water. Using models, students can describe the movement of
matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment and that energy in animals’
food was once energy from the sun. Students are expected to develop an understanding of
patterns of daily changes in length and direction of shadows, day and night, and the seasonal
appearance of some stars in the night sky. The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and
effect; scale, proportion, and quantity; energy and matter; and systems and systems models
are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the fifth grade
performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency
in developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and
interpreting data, using mathematics and computational thinking, engaging in argument from
evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information; and to use these practices
to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

                               Middle School Physical Science
Students in middle school continue to develop understanding of four core ideas in the physical
sciences. The middle school performance expectations in the Physical Sciences build on the K – 5
ideas and capabilities to allow learners to explain phenomena central to the physical sciences but
also to the life sciences and earth and space science. The performance expectations in physical
science blend the core ideas with scientific and engineering practices and crosscutting concepts to
support students in developing useable knowledge to explain real world phenomena in the
physical, biological, and earth and space sciences. In the physical sciences, performance
expectations at the middle school level focus on students developing understanding of several
scientific practices. These include developing and using models, planning and conducting
investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, using mathematical and computational thinking,
and constructing explanations; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the
core ideas. Students are also expected to demonstrate understanding of several of engineering
practices including design and evaluation.
The performance expectations in the topic Structure and Properties of Matter help students to
formulate an answer to the questions: “How can particles combine to produce a substance with
different properties? How does thermal energy affect particles?” by building understanding of what
occurs at the atomic and molecular scale. By the end of middle school, students will be able to
apply understanding that pure substances have characteristic properties and are made from a
single type of atom or molecule. They will be able to provide molecular level accounts to explain
states of matters and changes between states. The crosscutting concepts of cause and effect;
scale, proportion and quantity; structure and function; interdependence of science, engineering,
and technology; and influence of science, engineering and technology on society and the natural
world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In these performance
expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models,
and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. Students use these scientific and
engineering practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
The performance expectations in the topic Chemical Reactions help students to formulate an
answer to the questions: “What happens when new materials are formed? What stays the same
and what changes?” by building understanding of what occurs at the atomic and molecular scale
during chemical reactions. By the end of middle school, students will be able to provide molecular
level accounts to explain that chemical reactions involve regrouping of atoms to form new
substances, and that atoms rearrange during chemical reactions. Students are also able to apply
an understanding of the design and the process of optimization in engineering to chemical reaction
systems. The crosscutting concepts of patterns and energy and matter are called out as organizing
concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In these performance expectations, students are
expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, analyzing and interpreting
data, and designing solutions. Students use these scientific and engineering practices to
demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
The performance expectations in the topic Forces and Interactions focus on helping students
understand ideas related to why some objects will keep moving, why objects fall to the ground and
why some materials are attracted to each other while others are not. Students answer the
question, “How can one describe physical interactions between objects and within systems of
objects?” At the middle school level, the PS2 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework is
broken down into two sub-ideas: Forces and Motion and Types of interactions. By the end of
  September 2017                     ©2013 Achieve, Inc. All rights reserved.                33 of 102


middle school, students will be able to apply Newton’s Third Law of Motion to relate forces to
explain the motion of objects. Students also apply ideas about gravitational, electrical, and
magnetic forces to explain a variety of phenomena including beginning ideas about why some
materials attract each other while other repel. In particular, students will develop understanding
that gravitational interactions are always attractive but that electrical and magnetic forces can be
both attractive and negative. Students also develop ideas that objects can exert forces on each
other even though the objects are not in contact, through fields. Students are also able to apply an
engineering practice and concept to solve a problem caused when objects collide. The crosscutting
concepts of cause and effect; system and system models; stability and change; and the influence
of science, engineering, and technology on society and the natural world serve as organizing
concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In these performance expectations, students are
expected to demonstrate proficiency in asking questions, planning and carrying out investigations,
and designing solutions, and engaging in argument; and to use these practices to demonstrate
understanding of the core ideas.
The performance expectations in the topic Energy help students formulate an answer to the
question, “How can energy be transferred from one object or system to another?” At the middle
school level, the PS3 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework is broken down into four
sub-core ideas: Definitions of Energy, Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer, the
Relationship between Energy and Forces, and Energy in Chemical Process and Everyday Life.
Students develop their understanding of important qualitative ideas about energy including that
the interactions of objects can be explained and predicted using the concept of transfer of energy
from one object or system of objects to another, and that that the total change of energy in any
system is always equal to the total energy transferred into or out of the system. Students
understand that objects that are moving have kinetic energy and that objects may also contain
stored (potential) energy, depending on their relative positions. Students will also come to know
the difference between energy and temperature, and begin to develop an understanding of the
relationship between force and energy. Students are also able to apply an understanding of design
to the process of energy transfer. The crosscutting concepts of scale, proportion, and quantity;
systems and system models; and energy are called out as organizing concepts for these
disciplinary core ideas. These performance expectations expect students to demonstrate
proficiency in developing and using models, planning investigations, analyzing and interpreting
data, and designing solutions, and engaging in argument from evidence; and to use these
practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas in PS3.
The performance expectations in the topic Waves and Electromagnetic Radiation help
students formulate an answer to the question, “What are the characteristic properties of waves
and how can they be used?” At the middle school level, the PS4 Disciplinary Core Idea from the
NRC Framework is broken down into Wave Properties, Electromagnetic Radiation, and Information
Technologies and Instrumentation. Students are able to describe and predict characteristic
properties and behaviors of waves when the waves interact with matter. Students can apply an
understanding of waves as a means to send digital information. The crosscutting concepts of
patterns and structure and function are used as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core
ideas. These performance expectations focus on students demonstrating proficiency in developing
and using models, using mathematical thinking, and obtaining, evaluating and communicating
information; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

                      impact society. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on natural resources that undergo a chemical process to form the synthetic material. Examples of new
                      materials could include new medicine, foods, and alternative fuels.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to qualitative information.]
 MS-PS1-4.            Develop a model that predicts and describes changes in particle motion, temperature, and state of a pure
                      substance when thermal energy is added or removed. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on qualitative molecular-level models of solids,
                      liquids, and gases to show that adding or removing thermal energy increases or decreases kinetic energy of the particles until a change of state occurs. Examples of
                      models could include drawings and diagrams. Examples of particles could include molecules or inert atoms. Examples of pure substances could include water, carbon
                      dioxide, and helium.]

                      from kinetic energy and speed. Examples could include riding a bicycle at different speeds, rolling different sizes of rocks downhill, and getting hit by a wiffle ball
                      versus a tennis ball.]
 MS-PS3-2. Develop a model to describe that when the arrangement of objects interacting at a distance changes, different
                     amounts of potential energy are stored in the system. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on relative amounts of potential energy, not on
                     calculations of potential energy. Examples of objects within systems interacting at varying distances could include: the Earth and either a roller coaster cart at varying
                     positions on a hill or objects at varying heights on shelves, changing the direction/orientation of a magnet, and a balloon with static electrical charge being brought
                     closer to a classmate’s hair. Examples of models could include representations, diagrams, pictures, and written descriptions of systems.] [Assessment Boundary:
                     Assessment is limited to two objects and electric, magnetic, and gravitational interactions.]

                     Boundary: Assessment does not include calculating the total amount of thermal energy transferred.]
  MS-PS3-4. Plan an investigation to determine the relationships among the energy transferred, the type of matter, the mass,
                      and the change in the average kinetic energy of the particles as measured by the temperature of the sample.

                      with the same initial temperature, the temperature change of samples of different materials with the same mass as they cool or heat in the environment, or the same
                      material with different masses when a specific amount of energy is added.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include calculating the total amount of

                     inventory or other representation of the energy before and after the transfer in the form of temperature changes or motion of object.] [Assessment Boundary:

                                  Middle School Life Sciences
Students in middle school develop understanding of key concepts to help them make sense of
the life sciences. These ideas build upon students’ science understanding from earlier grades
and from the disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting
concepts of other experiences with physical and earth sciences. There are five life science topics
in middle school: 1) Structure, Function, and Information Processing, 2) Growth, Development,
and Reproduction of Organisms, 3) Matter and Energy in Organisms and Ecosystems, 4)
Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems, and 5) Natural Selection and Adaptations. The
performance expectations in middle school blend core ideas with scientific and engineering
practices and crosscutting concepts to support students in developing useable knowledge across
the science disciplines. While the performance expectations in middle school life science couple
particular practices with specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional decisions should include
use of many science and engineering practices integrated in the performance expectations. The
concepts and practices in the performance expectations are based on the grade-band endpoints
described in A Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012).
The Performance Expectations in Structure, Function, and Information Processing help
students formulate an answer to the question, “How do the structures of organisms contribute
to life’s functions?” Middle school students can plan and carry out investigations to develop
evidence that living organisms are made of cells and to determine the relationship of organisms
to the environment. Students can use understanding of cell theory to develop physical and
conceptual models of cells. They can construct explanations for the interactions of systems in
cells and organisms and how organisms gather and use information from the environment. By
the end of their studies, students understand that all organisms are made of cells, that special
structures are responsible for particular functions in organisms, and that for many organisms
the body is a system of multiple interacting subsystems that form a hierarchy from cells to the
body. Crosscutting concepts of cause and effect, structure and function, and matter and energy
are called out as organizing concepts for these core ideas.
The Performance Expectations in Growth, Development, and Reproduction of Organisms
help students formulate an answer to the question, “How do organisms grow, develop, and
reproduce?” Students understand how the environment and genetic factors determine the
growth of an individual organism. They also demonstrate understanding of the genetic
implications for sexual and asexual reproduction. Students can develop evidence to support
their understanding of the structures and behaviors that increase the likelihood of successful
reproduction by organisms. They have a beginning understanding of the ways humans can
select for specific traits, the role of technology, genetic modification, and the nature of ethical
responsibilities related to selective breeding. At the end of middle school, students can explain
how selected structures, functions, and behaviors of organisms change in predictable ways as
they progress from birth to old age. Students can use the practices of analyzing and
interpreting data, using models, conducting investigations and communicating information.
Crosscutting concepts of structure and function, change and stability, and matter and energy
flow in organisms support understanding across this topic.

The Performance Expectations in Matter and Energy in Organisms and Ecosystems help
students formulate answers to the questions: “How do organisms obtain and use matter and
energy? How do matter and energy move through an ecosystem?” Middle school students can
use conceptual and physical models to explain the transfer of energy and cycling of matter as
they construct explanations for the role of photosynthesis in cycling matter in ecosystems. They
can construct explanations for the cycling of matter in organisms and the interactions of
organisms to obtain the matter and energy from the ecosystem to survive and grow. Students
have a grade-appropriate understanding and use of the practices of investigations, constructing
arguments based on evidence, and oral and written communication. They understand that
sustaining life requires substantial energy and matter inputs and the structure and functions of
organisms contribute to the capture, transformation, transport, release, and elimination of
matter and energy. Adding to these crosscutting concepts is a deeper understanding of systems
and system models that ties the performances expectations in this topic together.
The Performance Expectations in Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems help
students formulate an answer to the question, “How do organisms interact with other
organisms in the physical environment to obtain matter and energy? To answer the question,
middle school students construct explanations for the interactions in ecosystems and the
scientific, economic, political, and social justifications used in making decisions about
maintaining biodiversity in ecosystems. Students can use models, construct evidence-based
explanations, and use argumentation from evidence. Students understand that organisms and
populations of organisms are dependent on their environmental interactions both with other
organisms and with nonliving factors. They also understand the limits of resources influence the
growth of organisms and populations, which may result in competition for those limited
resources. Crosscutting concepts of matter and energy, systems and system models, and cause
and effect are used by students to support understanding the phenomena they study.
The Performance Expectations in Natural Selection and Adaptations help students
formulate answers to the questions: “How does genetic variation among organisms in a species
affect survival and reproduction? How does the environment influence genetic traits in
populations over multiple generations?” Middle school students can analyze data from the fossil
record to describe evidence of the history of life on Earth and can construct explanations for
similarities in organisms. They have a beginning understanding of the role of variation in natural
selection and how this leads to speciation. They have a grade-appropriate understanding and
use of the practices of analyzing graphical displays; using mathematical models; and gathering,
reading, and communicating information. The crosscutting concept of cause and effect is
central to this topic.

                    [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include the biochemical mechanisms of photosynthesis.]
  MS-LS1-7. Develop a model to describe how food is rearranged through chemical reactions forming new molecules that
                    support growth and/or release energy as this matter moves through an organism. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on
                    describing that molecules are broken apart and put back together and that in this process, energy is released.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include
                    details of the chemical reactions for photosynthesis or respiration.]
  MS-LS2-1. Analyze and interpret data to provide evidence for the effects of resource availability on organisms and
                    populations of organisms in an ecosystem. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on cause and effect relationships between resources and
                    growth of individual organisms and the numbers of organisms in ecosystems during periods of abundant and scarce resources.]
  MS-LS2-3. Develop a model to describe the cycling of matter and flow of energy among living and nonliving parts of an
                    ecosystem. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on describing the conservation of matter and flow of energy into and out of various ecosystems, and on
                    defining the boundaries of the system.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include the use of chemical reactions to describe the processes.]
  MS-LS2-4. Construct an argument supported by empirical evidence that changes to physical or biological components of an
                    ecosystem affect populations. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on recognizing patterns in data and making warranted inferences about changes
                    in populations, and on evaluating empirical evidence supporting arguments about changes to ecosystems.]

MS.Growth, Development, and Reproduction of Organisms
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
 MS-LS1-4. Use argument based on empirical evidence and scientific reasoning to support an explanation for how
                    characteristic animal behaviors and specialized plant structures affect the probability of successful reproduction
                    of animals and plants respectively. [Clarification Statement: Examples of behaviors that affect the probability of animal reproduction could include
                    nest building to protect young from cold, herding of animals to protect young from predators, and vocalization of animals and colorful plumage to attract mates for
                    breeding. Examples of animal behaviors that affect the probability of plant reproduction could include transferring pollen or seeds, and creating conditions for seed
                    germination and growth. Examples of plant structures could include bright flowers attracting butterflies that transfer pollen, flower nectar and odors that attract
                    insects that transfer pollen, and hard shells on nuts that squirrels bury.]
 MS-LS1-5. Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for how environmental and genetic factors influence the
                    growth of organisms. [Clarification Statement: Examples of local environmental conditions could include availability of food, light, space, and water.
                    Examples of genetic factors could include large breed cattle and species of grass affecting growth of organisms. Examples of evidence could include drought
                    decreasing plant growth, fertilizer increasing plant growth, different varieties of plant seeds growing at different rates in different conditions, and fish growing larger
                    in large ponds than they do in small ponds.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include genetic mechanisms, gene regulation, or biochemical processes.]
 MS-LS3-1. Develop and use a model to describe why structural changes to genes (mutations) located on chromosomes may
                    affect proteins and may result in harmful, beneficial, or neutral effects to the structure and function of the
                    organism. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on conceptual understanding that changes in genetic material may result in making different proteins.]
                    [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include specific changes at the molecular level, mechanisms for protein synthesis, or specific types of mutations.]
 MS-LS3-2. Develop and use a model to describe why asexual reproduction results in offspring with identical genetic
                    information and sexual reproduction results in offspring with genetic variation. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on using
                    models such as Punnett squares, diagrams, and simulations to describe the cause and effect relationship of gene transmission from parent(s) to offspring and
                    resulting genetic variation.]
 MS-LS4-5. Gather and synthesize information about technologies that have changed the way humans influence the
                    inheritance of desired traits in organisms. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on synthesizing information from reliable sources about the
                    influence of humans on genetic outcomes in artificial selection (such as genetic modification, animal husbandry, gene therapy); and, on the impacts these
                    technologies have on society as well as the technologies leading to these scientific discoveries.]

                       Middle School Earth and Space Sciences
    Students in middle school develop understanding of a wide range of topics in Earth and
    space science (ESS) that build upon science concepts from elementary school through
    more advanced content, practice, and crosscutting themes. There are six ESS standard
    topics in middle school: Space Systems, History of Earth, Earth’s Interior Systems,
    Earth’s Surface Systems, Weather and Climate, and Human Impacts. The content of the
    performance expectations are based on current community-based geoscience literacy
    efforts such as the Earth Science Literacy Principles (Wysession et al., 2012), and is
    presented with a greater emphasis on an Earth Systems Science approach. The
    performance expectations strongly reflect the many societally relevant aspects of ESS
    (resources, hazards, environmental impacts) as well as related connections to
    engineering and technology. While the performance expectations shown in middle
    school ESS couple particular practices with specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional
    decisions should include use of many practices that lead to the performance
    expectations.
    The performance expectations in MS.Space Systems help students formulate answers
    to the questions: “What is Earth’s place in the Universe?” and “What makes up our solar
    system and how can the motion of Earth explain seasons and eclipses?” Two sub-ideas
    from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance expectations: ESS1.A and
    ESS1.B. Middle school students can examine the Earth’s place in relation to the solar
    system, Milky Way galaxy, and universe. There is a strong emphasis on a systems
    approach, using models of the solar system to explain astronomical and other
    observations of the cyclic patterns of eclipses, tides, and seasons. There is also a strong
    connection to engineering through the instruments and technologies that have allowed
    us to explore the objects in our solar system and obtain the data that support the
    theories that explain the formation and evolution of the universe. The crosscutting
    concepts of patterns; scale, proportion, and quantity; systems and system models; and
    interdependence of science, engineering, and technology are called out as organizing
    concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the MS.Space Systems performance
    expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using
    models and analyzing and interpreting data; and to use these practices to demonstrate
    understanding of the core ideas.
    The performance expectations in MS.History of Earth help students formulate answers
    to the questions: “How do people figure out that the Earth and life on Earth have
    changed over time?” and “How does the movement of tectonic plates impact the surface
    of Earth?” Four sub-ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance
    expectations: ESS1.C, ESS2.A, ESS2.B, and ESS2.C. Students can examine geoscience
    data in order to understand the processes and events in Earth’s history. Important
    concepts in this topic are “Scale, Proportion, and Quantity” and “Stability and Change,”
    in relation to the different ways geologic processes operate over the long expanse of
    geologic time. An important aspect of the history of Earth is that geologic events and
    conditions have affected the evolution of life, but different life forms have also played
    important roles in altering Earth’s systems. In the MS.History of Earth performance
    expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in analyzing and

    interpreting data, and constructing explanations; and to use these practices to
    demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
    The performance expectations in MS.Earth’s Systems help students formulate
    answers to the questions: “How do the materials in and on Earth’s crust change over
    time?” and “How does water influence weather, circulate in the oceans, and shape
    Earth’s surface?” Three sub-ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed in these
    performance expectations: ESS2.A, ESS2.C, and ESS3.A. Students understand how
    Earth’s geosystems operate by modeling the flow of energy and cycling of matter within
    and among different systems. Students can investigate the controlling properties of
    important materials and construct explanations based on the analysis of real geoscience
    data. Of special importance in both topics are the ways that geoscience processes
    provide resources needed by society but also cause natural hazards that present risks to
    society; both involve technological challenges, for the identification and development of
    resources and for the mitigation of hazards. The crosscutting concepts of cause and
    effect, energy and matter, and stability and change are called out as organizing
    concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the MS.Earth’s Systems performance
    expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using
    models and constructing explanations; and to use these practices to demonstrate
    understanding of the core ideas.
    The performance expectations in MS.Weather and Climate help students formulate
    an answer to the question: “What factors interact and influence weather and climate?”
    Three sub-ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance
    expectations: ESS2.C, ESS2.D, and ESS3.D. Students can construct and use models to
    develop understanding of the factors that control weather and climate. A systems
    approach is also important here, examining the feedbacks between systems as energy
    from the sun is transferred between systems and circulates though the ocean and
    atmosphere. The crosscutting concepts of cause and effect, systems and system
    models, and stability and change are called out as organizing concepts for these
    disciplinary core ideas. In the MS.Weather and Climate performance expectations,
    students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in asking questions, developing and
    using models, and planning and carrying out investigations; and to use these practices
    to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
    The performance expectations in MS.Human Impacts help students formulate
    answers to the questions: “How can natural hazards be predicted?” and “How do human
    activities affect Earth systems?” Two sub-ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed
    in these performance expectations: ESS3.B and ESS3.C. Students understand the ways
    that human activities impacts Earth’s other systems. Students can use many different
    practices to understand the significant and complex issues surrounding human uses of
    land, energy, mineral, and water resources and the resulting impacts of their
    development. The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; and
    interdependence of science, engineering, and technology are called out as organizing
    concepts for these disciplinary core ideas.

                        Emphasis is on the analysis of data from Earth-based instruments, space-based telescopes, and spacecraft to determine similarities and differences among solar
                        system objects. Examples of scale properties include the sizes of an object’s layers (such as crust and atmosphere), surface features (such as volcanoes), and
                        orbital radius. Examples of data include statistical information, drawings and photographs, and models.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include

MS-ESS1-4. Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence from rock strata for how the geologic time scale is used to
                      organize Earth’s 4.6-billion-year-old history. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how analyses of rock formations and the fossils they
                      contain are used to establish relative ages of major events in Earth’s history. Examples of Earth’s major events could range from being very recent (such as the last
                      Ice Age or the earliest fossils of homo sapiens) to very old (such as the formation of Earth or the earliest evidence of life). Examples can include the formation of
                      mountain chains and ocean basins, the evolution or extinction of particular living organisms, or significant volcanic eruptions.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment

                      varying time and spatial scales. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how processes change Earth’s surface at time and spatial scales that can be
                      large (such as slow plate motions or the uplift of large mountain ranges) or small (such as rapid landslides or microscopic geochemical reactions), and how many
                      geoscience processes (such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and meteor impacts) usually behave gradually but are punctuated by catastrophic events. Examples of
                      geoscience processes include surface weathering and deposition by the movements of water, ice, and wind. Emphasis is on geoscience processes that shape local
                      geographic features, where appropriate.]
MS-ESS2-3.            Analyze and interpret data on the distribution of fossils and rocks, continental shapes, and seafloor structures to
                      provide evidence of the past plate motions. [Clarification Statement: Examples of data include similarities of rock and fossil types on different
                      continents, the shapes of the continents (including continental shelves), and the locations of ocean structures (such as ridges, fracture zones, and trenches).]

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
MS-ESS2-1.             Develop a model to describe the cycling of Earth’s materials and the flow of energy that drives this process.
                       [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the processes of melting, crystallization, weathering, deformation, and sedimentation, which act together to form minerals
                       and rocks through the cycling of Earth’s materials.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include the identification and naming of minerals.]

                       energy, and groundwater resources are the result of past and current geoscience processes. [Clarification Statement:
                       Emphasis is on how these resources are limited and typically non-renewable, and how their distributions are significantly changing as a result of removal by
                       humans. Examples of uneven distributions of resources as a result of past processes include but are not limited to petroleum (locations of the burial of organic
                       marine sediments and subsequent geologic traps), metal ores (locations of past volcanic and hydrothermal activity associated with subduction zones), and soil
                       (locations of active weathering and/or deposition of rock).]

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
MS-ESS2-5. Collect data to provide evidence for how the motions and complex interactions of air masses result in changes in
                      weather conditions. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how air masses flow from regions of high pressure to low pressure, causing weather (defined
                      by temperature, pressure, humidity, precipitation, and wind) at a fixed location to change over time, and how sudden changes in weather can result when different air
                      masses collide. Emphasis is on how weather can be predicted within probabilistic ranges. Examples of data can be provided to students (such as weather maps,
                      diagrams, and visualizations) or obtained through laboratory experiments (such as with condensation).] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include
                      recalling the names of cloud types or weather symbols used on weather maps or the reported diagrams from weather stations.]
MS-ESS2-6.            Develop and use a model to describe how unequal heating and rotation of the Earth cause patterns of
                      atmospheric and oceanic circulation that determine regional climates. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how patterns vary by
                      latitude, altitude, and geographic land distribution. Emphasis of atmospheric circulation is on the sunlight-driven latitudinal banding, the Coriolis effect, and resulting
                      prevailing winds; emphasis of ocean circulation is on the transfer of heat by the global ocean convection cycle, which is constrained by the Coriolis effect and the
                      outlines of continents. Examples of models can be diagrams, maps and globes, or digital representations.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include the
                      dynamics of the Coriolis effect.]
MS-ESS3-5.            Ask questions to clarify evidence of the factors that have caused the rise in global temperatures over the past
                      century. [Clarification Statement: Examples of factors include human activities (such as fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and agricultural activity) and
                      natural processes (such as changes in incoming solar radiation or volcanic activity). Examples of evidence can include tables, graphs, and maps of global and regional
                      temperatures, atmospheric levels of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, and the rates of human activities. Emphasis is on the major role that human activities
                      play in causing the rise in global temperatures.]

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
MS-ESS3-2.                Analyze and interpret data on natural hazards to forecast future catastrophic events and inform the development
                          of technologies to mitigate their effects. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how some natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions and
                          severe weather, are preceded by phenomena that allow for reliable predictions, but others, such as earthquakes, occur suddenly and with no notice, and thus are
                          not yet predictable. Examples of natural hazards can be taken from interior processes (such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions), surface processes (such as mass
                          wasting and tsunamis), or severe weather events (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods). Examples of data can include the locations, magnitudes, and
                          frequencies of the natural hazards. Examples of technologies can be global (such as satellite systems to monitor hurricanes or forest fires) or local (such as building
                          basements in tornado-prone regions or reservoirs to mitigate droughts).]
MS-ESS3-3.                Apply scientific principles to design a method for monitoring and minimizing a human impact on the
                          environment.* [Clarification Statement: Examples of the design process include examining human environmental impacts, assessing the kinds of solutions
                          that are feasible, and designing and evaluating solutions that could reduce that impact. Examples of human impacts can include water usage (such as the withdrawal
                          of water from streams and aquifers or the construction of dams and levees), land usage (such as urban development, agriculture, or the removal of wetlands), and
                          pollution (such as of the air, water, or land).]
MS-ESS3-4.                Construct an argument supported by evidence for how increases in human population and per-capita
                          consumption of natural resources impact Earth’s systems. [Clarification Statement: Examples of evidence include grade-appropriate
                          databases on human populations and the rates of consumption of food and natural resources (such as freshwater, mineral, and energy). Examples of impacts can
                          include changes to the appearance, composition, and structure of Earth’s systems as well as the rates at which they change. The consequences of increases in
                          human populations and consumption of natural resources are described by science, but science does not make the decisions for the actions society takes.]

                             Middle School Engineering Design
    By the time students reach middle school they should have had numerous experiences in
    engineering design. The goal for middle school students is to define problems more
    precisely, to conduct a more thorough process of choosing the best solution, and to
    optimize the final design.
    Defining the problem with “precision” involves thinking more deeply than is expected in
    elementary school about the needs a problem is intended to address, or the goals a
    design is intended to reach. How will the end user decide whether or not the design is
    successful? Also at this level students are expected to consider not only the end user, but
    also the broader society and the environment. Every technological change is likely to
    have both intended and unintended effects. It is up to the designer to try to anticipate
    the effects it may have, and to behave responsibly in developing a new or improved
    technology. These considerations may take the form of either criteria or constraints on
    possible solutions.
    Developing possible solutions does not explicitly address generating design ideas
    since students were expected to develop the capability in elementary school. The focus in
    middle school is on a two stage process of evaluating the different ideas that have been
    proposed: by using a systematic method, such as a tradeoff matrix, to determine which
    solutions are most promising, and by testing different solutions, and then combining the
    best ideas into new solution that may be better than any of the preliminary ideas.
    Improving designs at the middle school level involves an iterative process in which
    students test the best design, analyze the results, modify the design accordingly, and then
    re-test and modify the design again. Students may go through this cycle two, three, or
    more times in order to reach the optimal (best possible) result.
    Connections with other science disciplines help students develop these capabilities in
    various contexts. For example, in the life sciences students apply their engineering design
    capabilities to evaluate plans for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services (MS-LS2-
    5). In the physical sciences students define and solve problems involving a number of core
    ideas in physical science, including: chemical processes that release or absorb energy
    (MS-PS1-6), Newton’s third law of motion (MS-PS2-1), and energy transfer (MS-PS3-3). In
    the Earth and space sciences students apply their engineering design capabilities to
    problems related the impacts of humans on Earth systems (MS-ESS3-3).
    By the end of 8th grade students are expected to achieve all four performance
    expectations (MS-ETS1-1, MS-ETS1-2, MS-ETS1-3, and MS-ETS1-4) related to a single
    problem in order to understand the interrelated processes of engineering design. These
    include defining a problem by precisely specifying criteria and constraints for solutions as
    well as potential impacts on society and the natural environment, systematically
    evaluating alternative solutions, analyzing data from tests of different solutions and
    combining the best ideas into an improved solution, and developing a model and
    iteratively testing and improving it to reach an optimal solution. While the performance
    expectations shown in Middle School Engineering Design couple particular practices with
    specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional decisions should include use of many practices
    that lead to the performance expectations.

                              High School Physical Sciences
Students in high school continue to develop their understanding of the four core ideas in the
physical sciences. These ideas include the most fundamental concepts from chemistry and
physics, but are intended to leave room for expanded study in upper-level high school courses.
The high school performance expectations in Physical Science build on the middle school ideas
and skills and allow high school students to explain more in-depth phenomena central not only
to the physical sciences, but to life and earth and space sciences as well. These performance
expectations blend the core ideas with scientific and engineering practices and crosscutting
concepts to support students in developing useable knowledge to explain ideas across the
science disciplines. In the physical science performance expectations at the high school level,
there is a focus on several scientific practices. These include developing and using models,
planning and conducting investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, using mathematical
and computational thinking, and constructing explanations; and to use these practices to
demonstrate understanding of the core ideas. Students are also expected to demonstrate
understanding of several engineering practices, including design and evaluation.
The performance expectations in the topic Structure and Properties of Matter help students
formulate an answer to the question, “How can one explain the structure and properties of
matter?” Two sub-ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance
expectations: the structure and properties of matter, and nuclear processes. Students are
expected to develop understanding of the substructure of atoms and provide more mechanistic
explanations of the properties of substances. Students are able to use the periodic table as a
tool to explain and predict the properties of elements. Phenomena involving nuclei are also
important to understand, as they explain the formation and abundance of the elements,
radioactivity, the release of energy from the sun and other stars, and the generation of nuclear
power. The crosscutting concepts of patterns, energy and matter, and structure and function
are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In these performance
expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models,
planning and conducting investigations, and communicating scientific and technical information;
and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
The performance expectations in the topic Chemical Reactions help students formulate an
answer to the questions: “How do substances combine or change (react) to make new
substances? How does one characterize and explain these reactions and make predictions about
them?” Chemical reactions, including rates of reactions and energy changes, can be understood
by students at this level in terms of the collisions of molecules and the rearrangements of
atoms. Using this expanded knowledge of chemical reactions, students are able to explain
important biological and geophysical phenomena. Students are also able to apply an
understanding of the process of optimization in engineering design to chemical reaction
systems. The crosscutting concepts of patterns, energy and matter, and stability and change
are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In these performance
expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models,
using mathematical thinking, constructing explanations, and designing solutions; and to use
these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
The Performance Expectations associated with the topic Forces and Interactions supports
students’ understanding of ideas related to why some objects will keep moving, why objects fall

to the ground, and why some materials are attracted to each other while others are not.
Students should be able to answer the question, “How can one explain and predict interactions
between objects and within systems of objects?” The disciplinary core idea expressed in the
Framework for PS2 is broken down into the sub ideas of Forces and Motion and Types of
Interactions. The performance expectations in PS2 focus on students building understanding of
forces and interactions and Newton’s Second Law. Students also develop understanding that
the total momentum of a system of objects is conserved when there is no net force on the
system. Students are able to use Newton’s Law of Gravitation and Coulomb’s Law to describe
and predict the gravitational and electrostatic forces between objects. Students are able to
apply scientific and engineering ideas to design, evaluate, and refine a device that minimizes
the force on a macroscopic object during a collision. The crosscutting concepts of patterns,
cause and effect, and systems and system models are called out as organizing concepts for
these disciplinary core ideas. In the PS2 performance expectations, students are expected to
demonstrate proficiency in planning and conducting investigations, analyzing data and using
math to support claims, and applying scientific ideas to solve design problems; and to use these
practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
The Performance Expectations associated with the topic Energy help students formulate an
answer to the question, “How is energy transferred and conserved?” The disciplinary core idea
expressed in the Framework for PS3 is broken down into four sub-core ideas: Definitions of
Energy, Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer, the Relationship between Energy and
Forces, and Energy in Chemical Process and Everyday Life. Energy is understood as quantitative
property of a system that depends on the motion and interactions of matter and radiation
within that system, and the total change of energy in any system is always equal to the total
energy transferred into or out of the system. Students develop an understanding that energy at
both the macroscopic and the atomic scale can be accounted for as either motions of particles
or energy associated with the configuration (relative positions) of particles. In some cases, the
energy associated with the configuration of particles can be thought of as stored in fields.
Students also demonstrate their understanding of engineering principles when they design,
build, and refine devices associated with the conversion of energy. The crosscutting concepts of
cause and effect; systems and system models; energy and matter; and the influence of science,
engineering, and technology on society and the natural world are further developed in the
performance expectations associated with PS3. In these performance expectations, students are
expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, planning and carry out
investigations, using computational thinking, and designing solutions; and to use these
practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
The Performance Expectations associated with the topic Waves and Electromagnetic
Radiation are critical to understand how many new technologies work. As such, this
disciplinary core idea helps students answer the question, “How are waves used to transfer
energy and send and store information?” The disciplinary core idea in PS4 is broken down into
Wave Properties, Electromagnetic Radiation, and Information Technologies and
Instrumentation. Students are able to apply understanding of how wave properties and the
interactions of electromagnetic radiation with matter can transfer information across long
distances, store information, and investigate nature on many scales. Models of electromagnetic
radiation as either a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields or as particles are developed
and used. Students understand that combining waves of different frequencies can make a wide
variety of patterns and thereby encode and transmit information. Students also demonstrate

their understanding of engineering ideas by presenting information about how technological
devices use the principles of wave behavior and wave interactions with matter to transmit and
capture information and energy. The crosscutting concepts of cause and effect; systems and
system models; stability and change; interdependence of science, engineering, and technology;
and the influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural world are
highlighted as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the PS3 performance
expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in asking questions, using
mathematical thinking, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating and
communicating information; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the
core ideas.

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
 HS-PS1-1. Use the periodic table as a model to predict the relative properties of elements based on the patterns of
                       electrons in the outermost energy level of atoms. [Clarification Statement: Examples of properties that could be predicted from patterns
                       could include reactivity of metals, types of bonds formed, numbers of bonds formed, and reactions with oxygen.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited
                       to main group elements. Assessment does not include quantitative understanding of ionization energy beyond relative trends.]
 HS-PS1-3.             Plan and conduct an investigation to gather evidence to compare the structure of substances at the bulk scale
                       to infer the strength of electrical forces between particles. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on understanding the strengths of
                       forces between particles, not on naming specific intermolecular forces (such as dipole-dipole). Examples of particles could include ions, atoms, molecules, and
                       networked materials (such as graphite). Examples of bulk properties of substances could include the melting point and boiling point, vapor pressure, and surface
                       tension.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include Raoult’s law calculations of vapor pressure.]
 HS-PS1-8.             Develop models to illustrate the changes in the composition of the nucleus of the atom and the energy
                       released during the processes of fission, fusion, and radioactive decay. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on simple
                       qualitative models, such as pictures or diagrams, and on the scale of energy released in nuclear processes relative to other kinds of transformations.]
                       [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include quantitative calculation of energy released. Assessment is limited to alpha, beta, and gamma radioactive
                       decays.]
 HS-PS2-6.             Communicate scientific and technical information about why the molecular-level structure is important in the
                       functioning of designed materials.* [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the attractive and repulsive forces that determine the functioning
                       of the material. Examples could include why electrically conductive materials are often made of metal, flexible but durable materials are made up of long chained
                       molecules, and pharmaceuticals are designed to interact with specific receptors.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to provided molecular structures
                       of specific designed materials.]

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
   HS-PS1-2. Construct and revise an explanation for the outcome of a simple chemical reaction based on the outermost
                         electron states of atoms, trends in the periodic table, and knowledge of the patterns of chemical properties.
                         [Clarification Statement: Examples of chemical reactions could include the reaction of sodium and chlorine, of carbon and oxygen, or of carbon and hydrogen.]
                         [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to chemical reactions involving main group elements and combustion reactions.]
   HS-PS1-4.             Develop a model to illustrate that the release or absorption of energy from a chemical reaction system
                         depends upon the changes in total bond energy. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the idea that a chemical reaction is a system
                         that affects the energy change. Examples of models could include molecular-level drawings and diagrams of reactions, graphs showing the relative energies of
                         reactants and products, and representations showing energy is conserved.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include calculating the total bond
                         energy changes during a chemical reaction from the bond energies of reactants and products.]
   HS-PS1-5.             Apply scientific principles and evidence to provide an explanation about the effects of changing the
                         temperature or concentration of the reacting particles on the rate at which a reaction occurs. [Clarification
                         Statement: Emphasis is on student reasoning that focuses on the number and energy of collisions between molecules.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is

                         between rate and temperature.]
   HS-PS1-6.             Refine the design of a chemical system by specifying a change in conditions that would produce increased
                         amounts of products at equilibrium.* [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the application of Le Chatelier’s Principle and on refining
                         designs of chemical reaction systems, including descriptions of the connection between changes made at the macroscopic level and what happens at the
                         molecular level. Examples of designs could include different ways to increase product formation including adding reactants or removing products.] [Assessment

                         concentrations.]
   HS-PS1-7.             Use mathematical representations to support the claim that atoms, and therefore mass, are conserved
                         during a chemical reaction. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on using mathematical ideas to communicate the proportional relationships
                         between masses of atoms in the reactants and the products, and the translation of these relationships to the macroscopic scale using the mole as the
                         conversion from the atomic to the macroscopic scale. Emphasis is on assessing students’ use of mathematical thinking and not on memorization and rote
                         application of problem-solving techniques.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include complex chemical reactions.]

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
    HS-PS2-1. Analyze data to support the claim that Newton’s second law of motion describes the mathematical relationship
                       among the net force on a macroscopic object, its mass, and its acceleration. [Clarification Statement: Examples of data could
                       include tables or graphs of position or velocity as a function of time for objects subject to a net unbalanced force, such as a falling object, an object sliding down a
                       ramp, or a moving object being pulled by a constant force.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to one-dimensional motion and to macroscopic objects
                       moving at non-relativistic speeds.]
    HS-PS2-2. Use mathematical representations to support the claim that the total momentum of a system of objects is
                       conserved when there is no net force on the system. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the quantitative conservation of momentum
                       in interactions and the qualitative meaning of this principle.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to systems of two macroscopic bodies moving in one
                       dimension.]
    HS-PS2-3. Apply scientific and engineering ideas to design, evaluate, and refine a device that minimizes the force on a
                       macroscopic object during a collision.* [Clarification Statement: Examples of evaluation and refinement could include determining the success
                       of the device at protecting an object from damage and modifying the design to improve it. Examples of a device could include a football helmet or a parachute.]
                       [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to qualitative evaluations and/or algebraic manipulations.]
    HS-PS2-4. Use mathematical representations of Newton’s Law of Gravitation and Coulomb’s Law to describe and predict
                       the gravitational and electrostatic forces between objects. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on both quantitative and conceptual
                       descriptions of gravitational and electric fields.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to systems with two objects.]
    HS-PS2-5. Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that an electric current can produce a magnetic field and
                       that a changing magnetic field can produce an electric current. [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to designing and

                      Statement: Emphasis is on explaining the meaning of mathematical expressions used in the model.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to basic
                      algebraic expressions or computations; to systems of two or three components; and to thermal energy, kinetic energy, and/or the energies in gravitational,
                      magnetic, or electric fields.]
  HS-PS3-2.           Develop and use models to illustrate that energy at the macroscopic scale can be accounted for as a
                      combination of energy associated with the motions of particles (objects) and energy associated with the
                      relative position of particles (objects). [Clarification Statement: Examples of phenomena at the macroscopic scale could include the conversion
                      of kinetic energy to thermal energy, the energy stored due to position of an object above the earth, and the energy stored between two electrically-charged plates.
                      Examples of models could include diagrams, drawings, descriptions, and computer simulations.]
  HS-PS3-3.           Design, build, and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one form of energy into
                      another form of energy.* [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of devices. Examples of devices could
                      include Rube Goldberg devices, wind turbines, solar cells, solar ovens, and generators. Examples of constraints could include use of renewable energy forms and
                      efficiency.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment for quantitative evaluations is limited to total output for a given input. Assessment is limited to devices constructed
                      with materials provided to students.]
  HS-PS3-4.           Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that the transfer of thermal energy when two
                      components of different temperature are combined within a closed system results in a more uniform energy
                      distribution among the components in the system (second law of thermodynamics). [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is
                      on analyzing data from student investigations and using mathematical thinking to describe the energy changes both quantitatively and conceptually. Examples of
                      investigations could include mixing liquids at different initial temperatures or adding objects at different temperatures to water.] [Assessment Boundary:
                      Assessment is limited to investigations based on materials and tools provided to students.]
  HS-PS3-5.           Develop and use a model of two objects interacting through electric or magnetic fields to illustrate the forces
                      between objects and the changes in energy of the objects due to the interaction. [Clarification Statement: Examples of
                      models could include drawings, diagrams, and texts, such as drawings of what happens when two charges of opposite polarity are near each other.] [Assessment

Students who demonstrate understanding can:

                     and speed of waves traveling in various media. [Clarification Statement: Examples of data could include electromagnetic radiation traveling in a
                     vacuum and glass, sound waves traveling through air and water, and seismic waves traveling through the earth.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to
                     algebraic relationships and describing those relationships qualitatively.]
  HS-PS4-2. Evaluate questions about the advantages of using a digital transmission and storage of information.                                                                 [Clarification
                     Statement: Examples of advantages could include that digital information is stable because it can be stored reliably in computer memory, transferred easily, and
                     copied and shared rapidly. Disadvantages could include issues of easy deletion, security, and theft.]
  HS-PS4-3. Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning behind the idea that electromagnetic radiation can be described
                     either by a wave model or a particle model, and that for some situations one model is more useful than the other.
                     [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how the experimental evidence supports the claim and how a theory is generally modified in light of new evidence. Examples
                     of a phenomenon could include resonance, interference, diffraction, and photoelectric effect.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include using quantum
                     theory.]
  HS-PS4-4. Evaluate the validity and reliability of claims in published materials of the effects that different frequencies of
                     electromagnetic radiation have when absorbed by matter. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the idea that photons associated with
                     different frequencies of light have different energies, and the damage to living tissue from electromagnetic radiation depends on the energy of the radiation. Examples
                     of published materials could include trade books, magazines, web resources, videos, and other passages that may reflect bias.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is

                                  High School Life Sciences
Students in high school develop understanding of key concepts that help them make sense of
life science. The ideas are building upon students’ science understanding of disciplinary core
ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts from earlier grades. There
are five life science topics in high school: 1) Structure and Function, 2) Inheritance and
Variation of Traits, 3) Matter and Energy in Organisms and Ecosystems, 4) Interdependent
Relationships in Ecosystems, and 5) Natural Selection and Evolution. The performance
expectations for high school life science blend core ideas with scientific and engineering
practices and crosscutting concepts to support students in developing useable knowledge that
can be applied across the science disciplines. While the performance expectations in high school
life science couple particular practices with specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional
decisions should include use of many practices underlying the performance expectations. The
performance expectations are based on the grade-band endpoints described in A Framework for
K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012).
The performance expectations in the topic Structure and Function help students formulate
an answer to the question: “How do the structures of organisms enable life’s functions?” High
school students are able to investigate explanations for the structure and function of cells as the
basic units of life, the hierarchical systems of organisms, and the role of specialized cells for
maintenance and growth. Students demonstrate understanding of how systems of cells function
together to support the life processes. Students demonstrate their understanding through
critical reading, using models, and conducting investigations. The crosscutting concepts of
structure and function, matter and energy, and systems and system models in organisms are
called out as organizing concepts.
The performance expectations in the topic Inheritance and Variation of Traits help
students in pursuing an answer to the question: “How are the characteristics from one
generation related to the previous generation?” High school students demonstrate
understanding of the relationship of DNA and chromosomes in the processes of cellular division
that pass traits from one generation to the next. Students can determine why individuals of the
same species vary in how they look, function, and behave. Students can develop conceptual
models for the role of DNA in the unity of life on Earth and use statistical models to explain the
importance of variation within populations for the survival and evolution of species. Ethical
issues related to genetic modification of organisms and the nature of science can be described.
Students can explain the mechanisms of genetic inheritance and describe the environmental
and genetic causes of gene mutation and the alteration of gene expression. Crosscutting
concepts of structure and function, patterns, and cause and effect developed in this topic help
students to generalize understanding of inheritance of traits to other applications in science.
The performance expectations in the topic M atter and Energy in Organism s and
Ecosystem s help students answer the questions: “How do organisms obtain and use energy
they need to live and grow? How do matter and energy move through ecosystems?” High
school students can construct explanations for the role of energy in the cycling of matter in
organisms and ecosystems. They can apply mathematical concepts to develop evidence to
support explanations of the interactions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration and develop

models to communicate these explanations. They can relate the nature of science to how
explanations may change in light of new evidence and the implications for our understanding of
the tentative nature of science. Students understand organisms’ interactions with each other
and their physical environment, how organisms obtain resources, change the environment, and
how these changes affect both organisms and ecosystems. In addition, students can utilize the
crosscutting concepts of matter and energy and Systems and system models to make sense of
ecosystem dynamics.
The performance expectations in the topic Interdependent R elationships in Ecosystem s
help students answer the question, “How do organisms interact with the living and non-living
environment to obtain matter and energy?” This topic builds on the other topics as high school
students demonstrate an ability to investigate the role of biodiversity in ecosystems and the role
of animal behavior on survival of individuals and species. Students have increased
understanding of interactions among organisms and how those interactions influence the
dynamics of ecosystems. Students can generate mathematical comparisons, conduct
investigations, use models, and apply scientific reasoning to link evidence to explanations about
interactions and changes within ecosystems.
The performance expectations in the topic Natural Selection and Evolution help students
answer the questions: “How can there be so many similarities among organisms yet so many
different plants, animals, and microorganisms? How does biodiversity affect humans?” High
school students can investigate patterns to find the relationship between the environment and
natural selection. Students demonstrate understanding of the factors causing natural selection
and the process of evolution of species over time. They demonstrate understanding of how
multiple lines of evidence contribute to the strength of scientific theories of natural selection
and evolution. Students can demonstrate an understanding of the processes that change the
distribution of traits in a population over time and describe extensive scientific evidence ranging
from the fossil record to genetic relationships among species that support the theory of
biological evolution. Students can use models, apply statistics, analyze data, and produce
scientific communications about evolution. Understanding of the crosscutting concepts of
patterns, scale, structure and function, and cause and effect supports the development of a
deeper understanding of this topic.

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 9–12 builds
on K–8 experiences and progresses to explanations and designs
that are supported by multiple and independent student-
generated sources of evidence consistent with scientific ideas,
principles, and theories.
  Construct an explanation based on valid and reliable evidence
     obtained from a variety of sources (including students’ own
     investigations, models, theories, simulations, peer review) and
     the assumption that theories and laws that describe the
     natural world operate today as they did in the past and will
     continue to do so in the future. (HS-LS1-1)

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
   HS-LS2-1. Use mathematical and/or computational representations to support explanations of factors that affect
                      carrying capacity of ecosystems at different scales. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on quantitative analysis and comparison of the
                      relationships among interdependent factors including boundaries, resources, climate and competition. Examples of mathematical comparisons could include
                      graphs, charts, histograms, and population changes gathered from simulations or historical data sets.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include
                      deriving mathematical equations to make comparisons.]
   HS-LS2-2. Use mathematical representations to support and revise explanations based on evidence about factors
                      affecting biodiversity and populations in ecosystems of different scales. [Clarification Statement: Examples of mathematical
                      representations include finding the average, determining trends, and using graphical comparisons of multiple sets of data.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is
                      limited to provided data.]
   HS-LS2-6. Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning that the complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively
                      consistent numbers and types of organisms in stable conditions, but changing conditions may result in a new
                      ecosystem. [Clarification Statement: Examples of changes in ecosystem conditions could include modest biological or physical changes, such as moderate
                      hunting or a seasonal flood; and extreme changes, such as volcanic eruption or sea level rise.]
   HS-LS2-7. Design, evaluate, and refine a solution for reducing the impacts of human activities on the environment and
                      biodiversity.* [Clarification Statement: Examples of human activities can include urbanization, building dams, and dissemination of invasive species.]
   HS-LS2-8. Evaluate the evidence for the role of group behavior on individual and species’ chances to survive and
                      reproduce. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on: (1) distinguishing between group and individual behavior, (2) identifying evidence supporting the
                      outcomes of group behavior, and (3) developing logical and reasonable arguments based on evidence. Examples of group behaviors could include flocking,
                      schooling, herding, and cooperative behaviors such as hunting, migrating, and swarming.]
   HS-LS4-6. Create or revise a simulation to test a solution to mitigate adverse impacts of human activity on biodiversity.*
                      [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on testing solutions for a proposed problem related to threatened or endangered species, or to genetic variation of
                      organisms for multiple species.]

HS.Inheritance and Variation of Traits
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
  HS-LS1-4. Use a model to illustrate the role of cellular division (mitosis) and differentiation in producing and maintaining
                       complex organisms. [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include specific gene control mechanisms or rote memorization of the steps of mitosis.]
  HS-LS3-1. Ask questions to clarify relationships about the role of DNA and chromosomes in coding the instructions for
                       characteristic traits passed from parents to offspring. [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include the phases of meiosis or the
                       biochemical mechanism of specific steps in the process.]
  HS-LS3-2. Make and defend a claim based on evidence that inheritable genetic variations may result from: (1) new genetic
                       combinations through meiosis, (2) viable errors occurring during replication, and/or (3) mutations caused by
                       environmental factors. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on using data to support arguments for the way variation occurs.] [Assessment Boundary:
                       Assessment does not include the phases of meiosis or the biochemical mechanism of specific steps in the process.]
  HS-LS3-3. Apply concepts of statistics and probability to explain the variation and distribution of expressed traits in a
                       population. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the use of mathematics to describe the probability of traits as it relates to genetic and environmental
                       factors in the expression of traits.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include Hardy-Weinberg calculations.]

HS.Natural Selection and Evolution
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
  HS-LS4-1. Communicate scientific information that common ancestry and biological evolution are supported by multiple
                       lines of empirical evidence. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on a conceptual understanding of the role each line of evidence has relating to
                       common ancestry and biological evolution. Examples of evidence could include similarities in DNA sequences, anatomical structures, and order of appearance of
                       structures in embryological development.]
  HS-LS4-2. Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from four factors: (1)
                       the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a species due
                       to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3) competition for limited resources, and (4) the proliferation of those
                       organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce in the environment. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on using
                       evidence to explain the influence each of the four factors has on number of organisms, behaviors, morphology, or physiology in terms of ability to compete for limited
                       resources and subsequent survival of individuals and adaptation of species. Examples of evidence could include mathematical models such as simple distribution
                       graphs and proportional reasoning.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include other mechanisms of evolution, such as genetic drift, gene flow through
                       migration, and co-evolution.]
  HS-LS4-3. Apply concepts of statistics and probability to support explanations that organisms with an advantageous
                       heritable trait tend to increase in proportion to organisms lacking this trait. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on analyzing
                       shifts in numerical distribution of traits and using these shifts as evidence to support explanations.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to basic statistical
                       and graphical analysis. Assessment does not include allele frequency calculations.]
  HS-LS4-4. Construct an explanation based on evidence for how natural selection leads to adaptation of populations.
                       [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on using data to provide evidence for how specific biotic and abiotic differences in ecosystems (such as ranges of seasonal
                       temperature, long-term climate change, acidity, light, geographic barriers, or evolution of other organisms) contribute to a change in gene frequency over time,
                       leading to adaptation of populations.]
  HS-LS4-5. Evaluate the evidence supporting claims that changes in environmental conditions may result in: (1) increases in
                       the number of individuals of some species, (2) the emergence of new species over time, and (3) the extinction of
                       other species. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on determining cause and effect relationships for how changes to the environment such as deforestation,
                       fishing, application of fertilizers, drought, flood, and the rate of change of the environment affect distribution or disappearance of traits in species.]

                        High School Earth and Space Sciences
    Students in high school develop understanding of a wide range of topics in Earth and
    space science (ESS) that build upon science concepts from middle school through more
    advanced content, practice, and crosscutting themes. There are five ESS standard topics
    in high school: Space Systems, History of Earth, Earth’s Systems, Weather and Climate,
    and Human Sustainability. The content of the performance expectations are based on
    current community-based geoscience literacy efforts such as the Earth Science Literacy
    Principles (Wysession et al., 2012), and is presented with a greater emphasis on an
    Earth Systems Science approach. There are strong connections to mathematical
    practices of analyzing and interpreting data. The performance expectations strongly
    reflect the many societally relevant aspects of ESS (resources, hazards, environmental
    impacts) with an emphasis on using engineering and technology concepts to design
    solutions to challenges facing human society. While the performance expectations
    shown in high school ESS couple particular practices with specific disciplinary core ideas,
    instructional decisions should include use of many practices that lead to the performance
    expectations.
    The performance expectations in HS.Space Systems help students formulate answers
    to the questions: “What is the universe, and what goes on in stars?” and “What are the
    predictable patterns caused by Earth’s movement in the solar system?” Four sub-ideas
    from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance expectations: ESS1.A,
    ESS1.B, PS3.D, and PS4.B. High school students can examine the processes governing
    the formation, evolution, and workings of the solar system and universe. Some concepts
    studied are fundamental to science, such as understanding how the matter of our world
    formed during the Big Bang and within the cores of stars. Others concepts are practical,
    such as understanding how short-term changes in the behavior of our sun directly affect
    humans. Engineering and technology play a large role here in obtaining and analyzing
    the data that support the theories of the formation of the solar system and universe.
    The crosscutting concepts of patterns; scale, proportion, and quantity; energy and
    matter; and interdependence of science, engineering, and technology are called out as
    organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the HS.Space Systems
    performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in
    developing and using models; using mathematical and computational thinking,
    constructing explanations; and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information;
    and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
    The performance expectations in HS.History of Earth help students formulate answers
    to the questions: “How do people reconstruct and date events in Earth’s planetary
    history?” and “Why do the continents move?” Four sub-ideas from the NRC Framework
    are addressed in these performance expectations: ESS1.C, ESS2.A, ESS2.B, and PS1.C.
    Students can construct explanations for the scales of time over which Earth processes
    operate. An important aspect of Earth and space science involves making inferences
    about events in Earth’s history based on a data record that is increasingly incomplete
    that farther you go back in time. A mathematical analysis of radiometric dating is used
    to comprehend how absolute ages are obtained for the geologic record. A key to Earth’s
    history is the coevolution of the biosphere with Earth’s other systems, not only in the
    ways that climate and environmental changes have shaped the course of evolution but

    also in how emerging life forms have been responsible for changing Earth. The
    crosscutting concepts of patterns and stability and change are called out as organizing
    concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the HS.History of Earth performance
    expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using
    models, constructing explanations, and engaging in argument from evidence; and to use
    these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
    The performance expectations in HS.Earth’s Systems help students formulate answers
    to the questions: “How do the major Earth systems interact?” and “How do the
    properties and movements of water shape Earth’s surface and affect its systems?” Six
    sub-ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance expectations:
    ESS2.A, ESS2.B, ESS2.C, ESS2.D, ESS2.E, and PS4.A. Students can develop models and
    explanations for the ways that feedbacks between different Earth systems control the
    appearance of Earth’s surface. Central to this is the tension between internal systems,
    which are largely responsible for creating land at Earth’s surface (e.g., volcanism and
    mountain building), and the sun-driven surface systems that tear down the land through
    weathering and erosion. Students understand the role that water plays in affecting
    weather. Students understand chemical cycles such as the carbon cycle. Students can
    examine the ways that human activities cause feedbacks that create changes to other
    systems. The crosscutting concepts of energy and matter; structure and function;
    stability and change; interdepence of science, engineering, and technology; and
    influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural world are
    called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the HS.Earth’s
    Systems performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in
    developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and
    interpreting data, and engaging in argument from evidence; and to use these practices
    to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.
    The performance expectations in HS.Weather and Climate help students formulate
    an answer to the question: “What regulates weather and climate?” Four sub-ideas from
    the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance expectations: ESS1.B, ESS2.A,
    ESS2.D, and ESS3.D. Students understand the system interactions that control weather
    and climate, with a major emphasis on the mechanisms and implications of climate
    change. Students can understand the analysis and interpretation of different kinds of
    geoscience data allow students to construct explanations for the many factors that drive
    climate change over a wide range of time scales. The crosscutting concepts of cause
    and effect and stability and change are called out as organizing concepts for these
    disciplinary core ideas. In the HS.Weather and Climate performance expectations,
    students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models and
    analyzing and interpreting data; and to use these practices to demonstrate
    understanding of the core ideas.
    The performance expectations in HS.Human Sustainability help students formulate
    answers to the questions: “How do humans depend on Earth’s resources?” and “How do
    people model and predict the effects of human activities on Earth’s climate?” Six sub-
    ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance expectations:
    ESS2.D, ESS3.A, ESS3.B, ESS3.C, ESS3.D, and ETS1.B. Students understand the
    complex and significant interdependencies between humans and the rest of Earth’s

    systems through the impacts of natural hazards, our dependencies on natural resources,
    and the environmental impacts of human activities. The crosscutting concepts of cause
    and effect; systems and system models; stability and change; and influence of
    engineering, technology and science on society and the natural world are called out as
    organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the HS.Human Sustainability
    performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in using
    mathematics and computational thinking, constructing explanations and designing
    solutions, and engaging in argument from evidence; and to use these practices to
    demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
    HS-ESS1-1. Develop a model based on evidence to illustrate the life span of the sun and the role of nuclear fusion in the
                          sun’s core to release energy that eventually reaches Earth in the form of radiation. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is
                          on the energy transfer mechanisms that allow energy from nuclear fusion in the sun’s core to reach Earth. Examples of evidence for the model include
                          observations of the masses and lifetimes of other stars, as well as the ways that the sun’s radiation varies due to sudden solar flares (“space weather”), the 11-
                          year sunspot cycle, and non-cyclic variations over centuries.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include details of the atomic and sub-atomic
                          processes involved with the sun’s nuclear fusion.]
    HS-ESS1-2.            Construct an explanation of the Big Bang theory based on astronomical evidence of light spectra, motion of
                          distant galaxies, and composition of matter in the universe. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the astronomical evidence of
                          the red shift of light from galaxies as an indication that the universe is currently expanding, the cosmic microwave background as the remnant radiation from the
                          Big Bang, and the observed composition of ordinary matter of the universe, primarily found in stars and interstellar gases (from the spectra of electromagnetic
                          radiation from stars), which matches that predicted by the Big Bang theory (3/4 hydrogen and 1/4 helium).]
    HS-ESS1-3.            Communicate scientific ideas about the way stars, over their life cycle, produce elements. [Clarification Statement:
                          Emphasis is on the way nucleosynthesis, and therefore the different elements created, varies as a function of the mass of a star and the stage of its lifetime.]
                          [Assessment Boundary: Details of the many different nucleosynthesis pathways for stars of differing masses are not assessed.]
    HS-ESS1-4.            Use mathematical or computational representations to predict the motion of orbiting objects in the solar
                          system. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on Newtonian gravitational laws governing orbital motions, which apply to human-made satellites as well as
                          planets and moons.] [Assessment Boundary: Mathematical representations for the gravitational attraction of bodies and Kepler’s Laws of orbital motions should
                          not deal with more than two bodies, nor involve calculus.]

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
  HS-ESS2-2. Analyze geoscience data to make the claim that one change to Earth’s surface can create feedbacks that
                         cause changes to other Earth systems. [Clarification Statement: Examples should include climate feedbacks, such as how an increase in
                         greenhouse gases causes a rise in global temperatures that melts glacial ice, which reduces the amount of sunlight reflected from Earth’s surface, increasing
                         surface temperatures and further reducing the amount of ice. Examples could also be taken from other system interactions, such as how the loss of ground
                         vegetation causes an increase in water runoff and soil erosion; how dammed rivers increase groundwater recharge, decrease sediment transport, and increase
                         coastal erosion; or how the loss of wetlands causes a decrease in local humidity that further reduces the wetland extent.]
  HS-ESS2-3.             Develop a model based on evidence of Earth’s interior to describe the cycling of matter by thermal convection.
                         [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on both a one-dimensional model of Earth, with radial layers determined by density, and a three-dimensional model, which
                         is controlled by mantle convection and the resulting plate tectonics. Examples of evidence include maps of Earth’s three-dimensional structure obtained from
                         seismic waves, records of the rate of change of Earth’s magnetic field (as constraints on convection in the outer core), and identification of the composition of
                         Earth’s layers from high-pressure laboratory experiments.]
  HS-ESS2-5.             Plan and conduct an investigation of the properties of water and its effects on Earth materials and surface
                         processes. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on mechanical and chemical investigations with water and a variety of solid materials to provide the
                         evidence for connections between the hydrologic cycle and system interactions commonly known as the rock cycle. Examples of mechanical investigations
                         include stream transportation and deposition using a stream table, erosion using variations in soil moisture content, or frost wedging by the expansion of water
                         as it freezes. Examples of chemical investigations include chemical weathering and recrystallization (by testing the solubility of different materials) or melt
                         generation (by examining how water lowers the melting temperature of most solids).]
  HS-ESS2-6.             Develop a quantitative model to describe the cycling of carbon among the hydrosphere, atmosphere,
                         geosphere, and biosphere. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on modeling biogeochemical cycles that include the cycling of carbon through the
                         ocean, atmosphere, soil, and biosphere (including humans), providing the foundation for living organisms.]
  HS-ESS2-7.             Construct an argument based on evidence about the simultaneous coevolution of Earth’s systems and life on
                         Earth. [Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the dynamic causes, effects, and feedbacks between the biosphere and Earth’s other systems, whereby
                         geoscience factors control the evolution of life, which in turn continuously alters Earth’s surface. Examples include how photosynthetic life altered the
                         atmosphere through the production of oxygen, which in turn increased weathering rates and allowed for the evolution of animal life; how microbial life on land
                         increased the formation of soil, which in turn allowed for the evolution of land plants; or how the evolution of corals created reefs that altered patterns of
                         erosion and deposition along coastlines and provided habitats for the evolution of new life forms.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include a
                         comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of how the biosphere interacts with all of Earth’s other systems.]

                             High School Engineering Design
    At the high school level students are expected to engage with major global issues at the
    interface of science, technology, society and the environment, and to bring to bear the
    kinds of analytical and strategic thinking that prior training and increased maturity make
    possible. As in prior levels, these capabilities can be thought of in three stages—defining
    the problem, developing possible solutions, and improving designs.
    Defining the problem at the high school level requires both qualitative and quantitative
    analysis. For example, the need to provide food and fresh water for future generations
    comes into sharp focus when considering the speed at which world population is growing,
    and conditions in countries that have experienced famine. While high school students are
    not expected to solve these challenges, they are expected to begin thinking about them as
    problems that can be addressed, at least in part, through engineering.
    Developing possible solutions for major global problems begins by breaking them
    down into smaller problems that can be tackled with engineering methods. To evaluate
    potential solutions students are expected to not only consider a wide range of criteria, but
    to also recognize that criteria need to be prioritized. For example, public safety or
    environmental protection may be more important than cost or even functionality.
    Decisions on priorities can then guide tradeoff choices.
    Improving designs at the high school level may involve sophisticated methods, such as
    using computer simulations to model proposed solutions. Students are expected to use
    such methods to take into account a range of criteria and constraints, to try and anticipate
    possible societal and environmental impacts, and to test the validity of their simulations by
    comparison to the real world.
    Connections with other science disciplines help high school students develop these
    capabilities in various contexts. For example, in the life sciences students are expected to
    design, evaluate, and refine a solution for reducing human impact on the environment
    (HS-LS2-7) and to create or revise a simulation to test solutions for mitigating adverse
    impacts of human activity on biodiversity (HS-LS4-6). In the physical sciences students
    solve problems by applying their engineering capabilities along with their knowledge of
    conditions for chemical reactions (HS-PS1-6), forces during collisions (HS-PS2-3), and
    conversion of energy from one form to another (HS-PS3-3). In the Earth and space
    sciences students apply their engineering capabilities to reduce human impacts on Earth
    systems, and improve social and environmental cost-benefit ratios (HS-ESS3-2, HS-ESS3-
    4).
    By the end of 12th grade students are expected to achieve all four HS-ETS1 performance
    expectations (HS-ETS1-1, HS-ETS1-2, HS-ETS1-3, and HS-ETS1-4) related to a single
    problem in order to understand the interrelated processes of engineering design. These
    include analyzing major global challenges, quantifying criteria and constraints for
    solutions; breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable problems,
    evaluating alternative solutions based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs, and using a
    computer simulation to model the impact of proposed solutions. While the performance
    expectations shown in High School Engineering Design couple particular practices with
    specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional decisions should include use of many practices
    that lead to the performance expectations.

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
  HS-ETS1-1. Analyze a major global challenge to specify qualitative and quantitative criteria and constraints for solutions
                        that account for societal needs and wants.
  HS-ETS1-2.            Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable
                        problems that can be solved through engineering.
  HS-ETS1-3.            Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs that account
                        for a range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics, as well as possible social, cultural,
                        and environmental impacts.
  HS-ETS1-4.            Use a computer simulation to model the impact of proposed solutions to a complex real-world problem with
                        numerous criteria and constraints on interactions within and between systems relevant to the problem.
