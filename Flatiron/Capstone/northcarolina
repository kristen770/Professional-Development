What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
1.P.1.1
Students know a force is a push or pull. Students know a force, a push or a pull, can change the motion of an object in three ways: go faster,
slower or change the direction of the motion. Students know a force (push or pull) is needed to start objects moving, keep objects moving or
stop objects that are moving.
1.P.1.2
Students know magnets exert an unseen force that makes some things move without touching them. Students know magnets have poles that
attract or repel each other.
1.P.1.3
Students know the size of the change in motion of an object is based on the amount of force applied to the object. Students know that balance
is associated with position and weight.

        growth of certain plants.
Unpacking
What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
1.E.2.1
Students know earth materials include solid rocks, soil and water, which all have different observable properties. Students know from prior
experiences that earth materials (matter) may be described by their physical properties (e.g., color, size, shape, weight, texture, flexibility,
attraction to magnets, floating or sinking in water). Students know that earth materials that retain their shape regardless of the container they
occupy are classified as solids. Students know that water is an Earth material that takes the shape of the container it occupies and is classified
as a liquid. Students know that earth materials have different properties that sustain plant and animal life. Students know that some Earth
materials have properties that make them useful in solving human problems.
1.E.2.2
Students know that soils have different properties based on where they are located on the earth. Students know that some soils retain more
water, nutrients and provide better structural support than others and therefore enhance the growth and development of certain plants.

Essential Standard and Clarifying Objectives
1.L.1 Understand characteristics of various environments and behaviors of humans that enable plants and animals
to survive.
        1.L.1.1 Recognize that plants and animals need air, water, light (plants only), space, food and shelter and that these may be found in
        their environment.
        1.L.1.2 Give examples of how the needs of different plants and animals can be met by their environments in North Carolina or different
        places throughout the world.
        1.L.1.3 Summarize ways that humans protect their environment and/or improve conditions for the growth of the plants and animals that
        live there (e.g., reuse or recycle products to avoid littering).
Unpacking
What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
1.L.1.1

2.P.1 Understand the relationship between sound and vibrating objects.
        2. P.1.1 Illustrate how sound is produced by vibrating objects and columns of air.
        2. P.1.2 Summarize the relationship between sound and objects of the body that vibrate – eardrum and vocal cords.
Unpacking
What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
2.P.1.1
Students know that vibrating objects produce sound. Students know that sound can be described in terms of pitch, which may be higher or
lower. Students know that the length of an air column determines if its pitch is high or low. Students know that the shorter the air column is,
the higher the pitch is. Students also know that the longer the air column is, the lower the pitch.
2.P.1.2
Students know parts of the body vibrate in order to produce and receive sound. Our voices produce sound when air from the lungs passes over
our vocal cords and makes them vibrate. The pitch and volume of the sounds humans can produce are changed by changing the properties of
the vocal cords. Students know that sound waves are collected by the outer ear, which helps to funnel sound to the eardrum. The eardrum
vibrates when sound waves hit it, and causes the tiny bones in the middle ear to vibrate as well. The vibrations move through the bones to the
inner ear where the sounds are changed into a form that is understood by the brain.

2.P.2 Understand properties of solids and liquids and the changes they undergo.
        2.P.2.1 Give examples of matter that change from a solid to a liquid and from a liquid to a solid by heating and cooling.
        2.P.2.2 Compare the amount (volume and weight) of water in a container before and after freezing.
        2.P.2.3 Compare what happens to water left in an open container over time as to water left in a closed container.
Unpacking
What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
2.P.2.1
Students know that solids are materials that maintain their own shapes, while liquids tend to assume the shapes of their containers. Students
know examples of materials that can be classified as solid and materials that can be classified as liquid. Students know water can be a liquid or
a solid and can go back and forth from one form to the other when heat is added or removed. (Other examples include: candle wax, shortening,
rock/lava). Students know things can be done to materials to change some of their properties, but not all materials respond the same way to
what is done to them.
2.P.2.2
Students know how to measure and compare the volume of a liquid poured into different containers. Students know how to measure and
compare the weight of water poured into different containers. Students know if water is turned into ice and then the ice is allowed to melt, the
amount of water is the same as it was before freezing.
2.P.2.3
Students know how to measure and compare the volume of liquid poured into different containers. Students know that a container of water left
open will contain less water over time, while a closed container of water will not change.

What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
4.E.2.1
Students know that fossils are evidence of living organisms that once existed on Earth. Students know that fossils share some characteristics
based on where, how, and from what they formed. Students know that some organisms that lived long ago are similar to existing organisms,
but some are quite different. Students know that organisms that are alive today, will, under the right conditions, leave fossil evidence.
4.E.2.2
Students know that fossils provide information about the environmental conditions that existed when the fossil organism was alive, as well as
information about where, when and how, the organism lived.
4.E.2.3
Students know that the surface of the earth changes over time. Students know that there are many factors that contribute to these changes.
Students know that such changes may be slow or rapid, subtle or drastic. Erosion and weathering are processes that change the Earth. Wind,
water (including ice), and chemicals break down rock and can carry soil from one place to another. Under the right conditions, gravity can
cause large sections of soil and rock to move suddenly down an incline. This is known as a landslide. Volcanic eruptions occur when heat and

pressure of melted rock and gases under the ground cause the crust of the Earth to crack and release these materials. Solid rock can deform or
break if it is subject to sufficient pressure. The vibration produced by this is called an earthquake.

Essential Standard and Clarifying Objectives
4.L.1 Understand the effects of environmental changes, adaptations and behaviors that enable animals (including
humans) to survive in changing habitats.
        4.L.1.1 Give examples of changes in an organism’s environment that are beneficial to it and some that are harmful.
        4.L.1.2 Explain how animals meet their needs by using behaviors in response to information received from the environment.
        4.L.1.3 Explain how humans can adapt their behavior to live in changing habitats (e.g., recycling wastes, establishing rain gardens,
        planting trees and shrubs to prevent flooding and erosion).
        4.L.1.4 Explain how differences among animals of the same population sometimes give individuals an advantage in surviving and
        reproducing in changing habitats.

What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
4.L.1.1
Students know that for any particular environment, some kinds of plants and animals survive well, some survive less well and some do not
survive at all. When the insect population grows in an area that is frequented by insect eating birds, this is advantageous for the birds.
Conversely, if the insect populations are decreased by disease in a similar scenario, the population of birds would be stressed and likely,
reduced.

Students know that animals collect information about the environment using their senses. Animals also exhibit instinctive (inborn) behaviors
that help them to survive. Students know that in animals, the brain processes information, and signals the performance of behaviors that help
the organism survive.
4.L.1.3
Students know that humans can adapt their behavior in order to conserve the materials and preserve the ecological systems that they depend on
for survival.
4.L.1.4
Students know that there is variation among individuals of one kind within a population. Students know that sometimes this variation results in
individuals having an advantage in surviving and reproducing. Survival advantage is not something that is acquired by an organism through
choice; rather it is the result of characteristics that the organism already possesses.

     This document is designed to help North Carolina educators teach the Essential Standards (Standard Course of Study). NCDPI staff
     are continually updating and improving these tools to better serve teachers.
     Essential Standards: Grade 5 Science
     For the Essential Standards that will be effective in all North Carolina schools in the 2012-13 school year.
What is the purpose of this document?
To increase student achievement by ensuring educators understand specifically what the new standards mean a student must know, understand and be
able to do.
What is in the document?
Descriptions of what each standard means a student will know, understand and be able to do. The “unpacking” of the standards done in this document is
an effort to answer a simple question “What does this standard mean that a student must know and be able to do?” and to ensure the description is
helpful, specific and comprehensive for educators.
How do I send Feedback?
We intend the explanations and examples in this document to be helpful and specific. That said, we believe that as this document is used, teachers and
educators will find ways in which the unpacking can be improved and made ever more useful. Please send feedback to us at feedback@dpi.state.nc.us
and we will use your input to refine our unpacking of the standards. Thank You!
Just want the standards alone?

                                                           Forces and Motion
Essential Standard and Clarifying Objectives
5.P.1 Understand force, motion and the relationship between them.
        5.P.1.1 Explain how factors such as gravity, friction, and change in mass affect the motion of objects.
        5.P.1.2 Infer the motion of objects in terms of how far they travel in a certain amount of time and the direction in which they travel.
        5.P.1.3 Illustrate the motion of an object using a graph to show a change in position over a period of time.
        5.P.1.4 Predict the effect of a given force or a change in mass on the motion of an object.
Unpacking
What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
5.P.1.1
Students know that gravity pulls any object on or near the earth toward it without touching it. Students know that friction is a force that is
created anytime two surfaces move or try to move across each other. Students know that all matter has mass. Students understand that
changing any or all of these factors will affect the motion of an object.
5.P.1.2
Students know that it is possible to measure the motion of an object based on the distance it will travel in a certain amount of time.
5.P.1.3
Students know that a graph can be created using one axis to represent the distance that an object travels, and the other axis to represent the
period of time the object is traveling. Students know how to construct a graph that demonstrates a relation of distance to time.
5.P.1.4
Students know that the greater a force is, the greater the change (in motion) it produces. The greater the mass of the object being acted on, the
less the effect of the (same) force.

5.P.2 Understand the interactions of matter and energy and the changes that occur.
        5.P.2.1 Explain how the sun’s energy impacts the processes of the water cycle (including, evaporation, transpiration, condensation,
        precipitation and runoff).
        5.P.2.2 Compare the weight of an object to the sum of the weight of its parts before and after an interaction.
        5.P.2.3 Summarize properties of original materials, and the new material(s) formed, to demonstrate that a change has occurred.
Unpacking
What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
5.P.2.1
Students know that the sun provides the energy that is a driving force for most biotic and abiotic cycles on the surface of the earth. Students

precipitation).
5.P.2.2
Students know that the weight of an object is equal to the weight of the sum of its parts. This is true in all closed systems.
5.P.2.3
Students know that by making qualitative and quantitative data records, we are able to create before/after representations of materials (and their
properties), so that we can compare before/after versions of materials.

Essential Standard and Clarifying Objectives
5.P.3 Explain how the properties of some materials change as a result of heating and cooling.
        5.P.3.1 Explain the effects of the transfer of heat (either by direct contact or at a distance) that occurs between objects at different
        temperatures. (conduction, convection or radiation).
        5.P.3.2 Explain how heating and cooling affect some materials and how this relates to their purpose and practical applications.
Unpacking
What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
5.P.3.1
Students know that when warmer things are put with cooler things, the warmer things lose heat and the cool things gain it until they are all at
the same temperature. Students know that a warmer object can warm a cooler object by contact or at a distance. Conduction is the transfer of
thermal energy between things that are touching. Conduction can happen within one object. (For example, thermal energy can be conducted
through the handle of a metal pot.) Convection is the movement of thermal energy by the movement of liquids or gases. Convection in the
oceans and atmosphere helps to move thermal energy around Earth, and is an important factor influencing weather and climate. Radiation is
the transfer of energy by electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves can carry energy through places with or without any matter. The Sun
is the main source of electromagnetic energy on Earth. Part of this energy, light, is used by producers to make food. Radiation can also happen
in other circumstances (i.e. sitting in front of a fireplace).
5.P.3.2
Students know that heating and cooling can cause changes in the properties of materials, but not all materials respond the same way to being
heated and cooled. Students know that heating and cooling cause changes in the properties of materials, such as water turning into steam by
boiling and water turning into ice by freezing. Students know and notice that many kinds of changes occur faster at higher temperatures.
Students know that some materials conduct heat much better than others, and poor conductors can reduce heat loss.

     Students need not come out of this grade span understanding heat or its difference from temperature. More important, students should
become familiar with the warming of objects that start out cooler than their environment, and vice versa. Computer lab ware probes and
graphic displays that detect small changes in temperature and plot them can be used by students to examine many instances of heat exchange.
Because many students think of cold as a substance that spreads like heat, there may be some advantage in translating descriptions of transfer
of cold into terms of transfer of heat.

5.E.1.2
Students know that one can collect and compare weather data in order to predict the likelihood of a particular weather condition occurring.
Students know how to read basic weather instruments: thermometer, barometer, anemometer, wind vane, and rain gauge. Students also can
identify atmospheric conditions (presence and type of clouds [stratus, cirrus, cumulous], fronts) that are associated with predictable weather
patterns. Students can make basic weather predictions using these skills.
5.E.1.3
Students know that local weather conditions are influenced by global factors such as air and water currents. The jet stream is an air current in
the upper atmosphere, located over North America that has a powerful influence on the weather conditions there. The jet stream flows from the
west to the east and changes location depending on global conditions. The Gulf stream is a warm water surface current in the Atlantic ocean
that moves from south of Florida up the eastern seaboard and then across the Atlantic. The Gulf stream moderates weather along the eastern
seaboard, warming the air and land there during the cooler months. In the Pacific, there is an oscillation of water temperatures known as El
Nino/La Nina. This oscillation impacts the climate of North and South America for long periods of time. Hurricanes are major storms that
form over warm ocean water and are caused by global weather patterns.

5.L.1.1
Students know that unicellular organisms consist of a single cell and perform all life processes within a single cell. Students know that
multicellular organisms are organisms that consist of more than one cell and have differentiated cells that perform specialized functions in the
organism. Students know that many organisms –including humans – are multicellular. Students know that in complex multicellular organisms,
only the surface cells that are in contact with the external environment are able to exchange substances with it. Cells within the organism are
too far away from the environment for direct exchange. This is the reason multicellular organisms have developed transport systems.

5. L.2.1
Students know that there are different types of ecosystems (terrestrial and aquatic). These ecosystems can be divided into two types according
to their characteristics:
Terrestrial
Land-based ecosystems include forests and grasslands.
Forests have many trees (with needles or with leaves), shrubs, grasses and ferns, and a variety of animals. They usually get more rain than
grasslands. Diverse types of animals can be found in forests, depending on their type. Deciduous: black bear, deer, red fox, vole, rabbit,
cardinal. Rain forest: panther, monkeys, capybara, snakes, spiders. Temperatures in the forests may vary depending on where the forest is
located.
Grasslands have fertile soil and are covered with tall grasses. They usually get a medium amount of rain, but less than forests. Temperatures
may also vary depending on where the grassland is located. Some examples of animals that live in the grasslands are prairie dogs, bison, and
grasshoppers.
Aquatic
Water-based ecosystems may be fresh water (lakes and ponds) or saltwater (oceans, estuaries and saltwater marshes).
Lakes and ponds are bodies of freshwater that are surrounded by land. Ponds are usually shallower than lakes and the temperature of the water
usually stays the same from top to bottom. Plants and algae usually grow along the edges where the water is shallow. Some examples of
animals may be different types of fish, amphibians, ducks, turtles, or beavers.
Oceans are large bodies of saltwater divided by continents. Oceans have many types of ecosystems depending on the conditions (sunlight,
temperature, depth, salinity) of that part of the ocean.
 Most organisms live where the ocean is shallow (from the shoreline to the continental shelf) because sunlight can reach deep and the water is
warm making food abundant. Some examples of organisms that live in the shallow ocean are drifters (jellyfish or seaweed), swimmers (fish),

crawlers (crabs), and those anchored to the ocean floor (corals).
Some organisms live in the open ocean, near the surface or down to the deep ocean bottom. Plankton float in the upper regions of the water.
Some organisms swim to the surface to find food or for air (whales, turtles, sharks) while others live closer to the bottom (certain fish, octopus,
tubeworms).
   Students know typical visual representations of the various ecosystems, as well as graphic representations of the food chains and webs,
cycles and energy pyramids that are commonly associated with ecosystems.
5.L.2.2
Students know that organisms in an ecosystem can be producers, consumers, or decomposers. Students know that producers convert energy
from the sun into organic matter through the process of photosynthesis. This organic matter is used by producers and consumers as food which
provides the energy that fuels basic life processes. Consumers sometimes consume only or mostly other consumers as a food source.
Producers and consumers produce wastes as they perform their life processes, and become waste organic matter when they die. Decomposers
use these waste materials and other non living organic matter to fuel their life processes and recycle nutrients that are necessary for producers
to carry out their life processes.
5.L.2.3
Students know that all of the organisms in an ecosystem have interconnected relationships. Students know that because of this, factors that
impact one population within an ecosystem may impact other populations within that ecosystem.

What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
5.L.3.1
Students know that the life processes and species characteristics that define a population will be transmitted from parent to offspring. Students
also know that these processes and characteristics cover a broad range of structures, functions and behaviors that can vary substantially from
individual to individual.
5.L.3.2
Students know some likenesses between parents and children are inherited. Other likenesses are learned from parents or within the community
(population/culture). Students know that in order for offspring to resemble their parents there must be a reliable way to transfer genetic
information from parent to offspring. Students can be encouraged to keep lists of characteristics that animals and plants acquire from their
parents, things that they don't, and things that the students are not sure about either way. This is also the time to start building the notion of a
population whose members are alike in many ways but show some variation.

     This document is designed to help North Carolina educators teach the Essential Standards (Standard Course of Study). NCDPI staff
     are continually updating and improving these tools to better serve teachers.
     Essential Standards: Grade 6 Science                    Unpacked Content
     For the Essential Standards that will be effective in all North Carolina schools in the 2012-13 school year.
What is the purpose of this document?
To increase student achievement by ensuring educators understand specifically what the new standards mean a student must know, understand and be
able to do.
What is in the document?
Descriptions of what each standard means a student will know, understand and be able to do. The “unpacking” of the standards done in this document is
an effort to answer a simple question “What does this standard mean that a student must know and be able to do?” and to ensure the description is
helpful, specific and comprehensive for educators.

        6.P.1.1 Compare the properties of waves to the wavelike property of energy in earthquakes, light and sound.
        6.P.1.2 Explain the relationship among visible light, the electromagnetic spectrum, and sight.

What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
6.P.1.1
All waves transmit energy not matter. Nearly all waves travel through matter. Waves are created when a source (force) creates a vibration.
Vibrations in materials set up wavelike disturbances that spread away from the source. Wave behavior can be described in terms of how fast
the disturbance spreads, and in terms of the distance between successive peaks of the disturbance (the wavelength). Sound and earthquake
waves are examples. These and other waves move at different speeds in different materials. Waves are moving energy. Light waves are
unique in their ability to travel through a vacuum (space). Sound is a form of energy that results when vibrating materials produce waves that
move through matter.
    Earthquakes are vibrations in the earth that release the (potential) energy stored in rocks (due to their relative positions and consequent
pressure). Earthquakes create seismic waves. Compare sound waves (longitudinal waves) to light waves (transverse waves). Energy will
cause materials to vibrate. These vibrations are carried as “waves” and transfer energy. Identify the basic characteristics of a transverse wave:
trough, crest, amplitude, and wavelength. Identify the basic characteristics of a longitudinal (compressional) wave: amplitude, rarefaction, and
compression.
6.P.1.2
Something can be "seen" when light waves emitted or reflected by it enter the eye. Human eyes respond to only a narrow range of wavelengths
of electromagnetic waves-visible light. Differences of wavelength within that range are perceived as differences of color. Light travels in

transverse waves. Light is a form of energy emitted by the Sun as well as light-producing objects on Earth. Light can be absorbed or reflected
by objects depending upon the properties of the object and the type and angle of light when it hits the object. Some materials scatter light and
others allow light rays to pass through, but refract the light by changing its speed.
   The structure of the human eye can detect many colors in visible light that are reflected by objects. Investigate how the eye works:
structures within the eye, functions of these structures in the eye. Optical illusions. Investigate conditions that impair vision.
6.P.1.3
Something can be "heard" when sound waves from it enter the ear. Sound is a form of energy that is caused when vibrating materials produce
waves that move through matter. These waves have different characteristics such as frequency and amplitude, which will determine the
properties of sound such as pitch and loudness.
   The form of the human ear can receive sound waves as vibrations and convert them to signals that are processed by the brain. Investigate
how sound travels through different solid materials. Compare how sound travels through different states of matter. Investigate how the vocal
cords work to produce sound: structure of vocal cords, function of vocal cords and conditions that affect the sound vocal cords make.
Investigate how the ear works: structures within the ear, functions of those structures, conditions that affect hearing.

Essential Standard and Clarifying Objectives
6.P.2 Understand the structure, classifications and physical properties of matter.
        6.P.2.1 Recognize that all matter is made up of atoms and atoms of the same element are all alike, but are different from the atoms of
        other elements.

        boiling point, melting point and solubility to properties that are dependent on the amount of matter present to include volume, mass and
        weight.

What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
6.P.2.1
Recognize that there are more than 100 elements that combine in a multitude of ways that make up all of the living and nonliving things that we
encounter. Recognize that matter is composed of extremely small particles, too small to be seen with a classroom microscope, called atoms.
Atoms have all of the properties of matter in that all atoms have mass and occupy space. Atoms are the smallest part of an element that has the
chemical properties of the element. Recognize that all atoms of the same element have the same properties; i.e. all iron atoms have the same
mass and occupy the same amount of space; therefore, all matter made of iron has the same properties because of the iron atoms. Also, iron
atoms are different from carbon atoms or from any other element.
NOTE: It is not essential for students to know the subatomic particles, for example, protons, neutrons, and electrons, which compose atoms.
Atomic models do not need to be constructed or drawn.
6.P.2.2
A substance in a: Solid phase is relatively rigid, has a definite volume and shape. The atoms that comprise a solid are packed close together
and are not compressible. Because all solids have some thermal energy, its atoms do vibrate. However, this movement is very small and very
rapid, and cannot be observed under ordinary conditions. When heat is added a solid can become a liquid. Liquids have a definite volume, but
are able to change their shape by flowing. Liquids are similar to solids in that the particles touch. However the particles are able to move
around. Since particles are able to touch the densities of liquid will be close to that of a solid (water is a special exception). Since the liquid
molecules can move they will take the shape of their container. When heat is added a liquid can become a gas. Gases have no definite volume
or shape. If unconstrained gases will spread out indefinitely. If confined they will take the shape of their container. This is because gas
particles have enough energy to overcome attractive forces. Each of the particles are well separated resulting in a very low density. Energy
appears in different forms. Heat energy is in the disorderly motion of molecules. Atoms and molecules are perpetually in motion. Increased
temperature means greater average energy of motion so most substances expand when heated. Most substances can exist as a solid, liquid or
gas depending on temperature.
6.P.2.3
A substance has characteristic properties such as density, a boiling point, melting point and solubility, all of which are independent of the
amount of the substance and can be used to identify it. Physical properties involve things that can be measured without changing the chemical

                                                                                                                                              5
properties. Matter can undergo physical changes which affect only physical properties. Physical changes can involve changes in energy.
   Solubility means the amount of solute that can be dissolved in a specific volume of solvent under certain conditions. A solute’s solubility
depends on the chemical nature of the solvent. Another important factor that influences solubility is the temperature of the system (the solute
and the solvent). The most common solvent is water.
   Density is a property that describes the relationship between mass and volume. Investigate the physical properties of pure substances in
terms of the unique temperatures at which each substance undergoes state changes. Investigate that melting and freezing of a pure substance
takes place at the same temperature and the boiling temperature is the same as the maximum condensing temperature. The temperature remains
constant during state changes of pure substances.

        and contraction) and electrical energy (conductors and insulators).

6.P.3.1
Energy can be transferred from one system to another (or from a system to its environment) in different ways:
        thermally, when a warmer object is in contact with a cooler one
     Grade 6 Science    Unpacked Content                                                                    Current as of March 28, 2011


                                                                                                                                                6
        mechanically, when two objects push or pull on each other over a distance
        electrically, when an electrical source such as a battery or generator is connected in a complete circuit to an electrical device
        by electromagnetic waves.
    Thermal energy is transferred through a material by the collisions of atoms within the material. Heat flows through materials or across
space from warm objects to cooler objects, until both objects are at equilibrium. Heat travels through solids, primarily by conduction. Heat is
circulated in fluids, both liquids and gases, through the process of convection. Radiation is energy that travels across distances in the form of
electromagnetic waves. Over time, thermal energy tends to spread out through a material and from one material to another if they are in
contact (conduction). Thermal energy can also be transferred by means of currents in air, water, or other fluids (convection).
6.P.3.2
Light and other electromagnetic waves can warm objects. How much an object’s temperature increases depends on how intense the light
striking its surface is, how long the light shines on the object, and how much of the light is absorbed. When light interacts with matter it is
either absorbed, transmitted, refracted) and/or reflected (scattered). An example of scattering is when the sky is blue. The sun is a major
source of energy for changes on the earth’s surface. The sun loses energy by emitting light. A tiny fraction of the light reaches the earth,
transferring energy from the sun to the earth. The sun’s energy arrives as light with a range of wavelengths, consisting of:
Visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to (can be detected by) human eyes. Electromagnetic radiation in
this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light.
Infrared light has a longer wavelength than visible light and is detected most often by its heating effect. Infrared imaging has applications in
space exploration and with satellite imaging.
Ultraviolet light has shorter wavelengths than visible light. These waves lengths are responsible for causing our sunburns. Most of these
waves are blocked from entering Earth’s atmosphere by the ozone but some days, more ultraviolet waves get through our atmosphere.
Scientists have developed a UV index to help people protect themselves from these harmful ultraviolet waves. These are the types of waves
used in tanning beds.
6.P.3.3
Thermal energy is transferred through a material by the collisions of atoms within the material. Over time, thermal energy tends to spread out
through a material and from one material to another if they are in contact (conduction). Thermal energy can also be transferred by means of
currents in air, water, or other fluids (convection). In addition, some thermal energy in all materials is transformed into light energy and
radiated into the environment by electromagnetic waves; that light energy can be transformed back into thermal energy when the

electromagnetic waves strike another material. As a result, a material tends to cool down unless some other form of energy is converted to
thermal energy in the material.
   There are some things that we use daily that we want to conduct heat easily. Most of these items are made of materials that conduct heat
readily: aluminum, steel, copper. We call these materials thermal conductors. Similarly, there are things that we do not want to conduct heat
(pot handles, spatula, cooking utensils) and these items are generally made of materials that limit heat transfer. We call such materials thermal
insulators. Expansion joint strips in bridges allow for the bridge to expand in hot weather and not break. These same joint strips allow for the
bridge to contract in cold weather and not break.
   Electrical energy also passes through conductors. An electrical conductor is a material through which an electrical current can flow easily.
An electrical insulator is a material through which electrical current does not readily flow. Electrical conductors include most metals, while
most nonmetallic solids (rubber, glass, porcelain, ceramic) are insulators.

6.E.1.1
The number of hours of daylight and the intensity of the sunlight both vary in a predictable pattern that depends on how far north or south of
the equator the place is. This variation explains why temperatures vary over the course of the year and at different locations. The Earth’s
moon revolves around the Earth as both go through space and revolve around the Sun. From Earth, our moon appears in a series of phases that
repeat in a regular cycle. Since the rotational period of the moon is the same as its period of revolution around the Earth, the same side of the
moon is always viewed from Earth.
    The moon and the Sun each exert a gravitational pull on the Earth. These gravitational forces can be aligned or in opposition to one another.
These forces as well as the Earth rotation have a major impact on the Earth’s ocean tides. Ocean tides follow a predictable pattern. The
alignment of the Sun, Earth and Moon can produce shadows on the Earth or Moon resulting in Lunar or Solar Eclipses. Eclipses are also
predictable. The Earth’s north-south axis is tilted at an angle, as compared with the plane of its revolution around the Sun. The rotation of the
Earth causes all parts of the Earth to experience periods of daylight and darkness. The revolution of the Earth around the Sun on its tilted axis
along with its daily rotation causes varying lengths of daylight on the Earth’s surface as well as changes in the directness and intensity of
sunlight. This results in a yearly cycle of seasons for much of the Earth’s surface. The tilt of the Earth’s axis also results in the seasons being
‘reversed’ in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. (e.g.: winter in North America corresponds to summer in South America.)
6.E.1.2
Eight planets of very different size, composition, and surface features move around the sun in nearly circular orbits. Some planets have a
variety of moons and even flat rings of rock and ice particles orbiting around them. Some of these planets and moon show evidence of
geologic activity. The earth is orbited by one moon, many artificial satellites, and debris. The Solar System consists of the Sun, planets,
moons, asteroids, meteors, comets, dust, gases and primarily empty space. The Sun is the major source of heat and light for the solar system.
Everything in the solar system is under the direct influence of the Sun’s gravitational pull. Planets are the largest objects in the solar system
and due to the Sun’s gravitational pull, they revolve around the sun with known frequencies. Atmosphere is a layer of air, made up of many
layers and gases that surround the Earth’s surface keeping humans safe from the sun’s radiation. The Earth formed in just the right place with
just the right ingredients for life to flourish. Our planet has liquid water, a breathable atmosphere and a suitable amount of sunshine to sustain
life.

developed tools and products that have become very important in enriching our lives. Humans have traveled to the moon, landed probes on
Mars and Venus, and sent probes speeding past Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. An International Space Station, through the joint effort of many
countries, was built to allow space to be studied continually. We also had the Hubble Telescope built so scientists could learn much more
about the uniqueness of Earth and its place in our solar system and universe. Scientists have also learned that there are millions of galaxies in
space, each containing solar systems. Many of our modern conveniences such as microwaves and hand held calculators are the result of
products developed for use in the space program. The Chandra X-ray Observatory is part of NASA’s fleet of “Great Observatories” along with
the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitizer Space Telescope and the now de-orbited Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Chandra allows
scientists from around the world to obtain X-ray images of exotic environments to help understand the structure and evolution of the universe.
Other telescopes, such as the Fermi-Gamma-ray Space Telescope has unveiled a previously unseen structure centered in the Milky Way. The
feature spans 50,000 light-years and may be the remnant of an eruption from a supersized black hole at the center of our galaxy.

The earth is composed – primarily- of rock. Three-fourths of the earth’s surface is covered by a relatively thin layer of water (some of it
frozen), and the entire planet is surrounded by a relatively thin layer of gas we call the atmosphere. The Earth has a solid inner core that is
surrounded by a liquid outer core. The inner core is a solid section of the Earth and is unattached to the mantle, being suspended by the molten
outer core. The inner core is predominantly iron metal with significant amounts of the element nickel. This inner layer in mutual combination
with the rotational motion of the Earth creates a dynamo effect where a force field is generated. This field is also known as Earth’s magnetic
field. In terms of the physical aspects of the outer core, the layer is dense but not as dense as pure molten iron. Surrounding the entire dense,
metallic core is a thick, hot, convective layer called the mantle. The crust consists of many continental and oceanic plates that have slowly
moved and changed positions on the globe throughout geologic time.
6.E.2.2
The earth's plates sit on a dense, hot, somewhat melted layer of the earth. The plates move very slowly, pressing against one another in some
places and pulling apart in other places, sometimes scraping alongside each other as they do. Mountains form as two continental plates, or an
ocean plate and a continental plate, press together. There are worldwide patterns to major geological events (such as earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions, and mountain building) that coincide with plate boundaries. Lithospheric plates on the scale of continents and oceans constantly
move at rates of centimeters per year as a result of movements in the mantle coupled with characteristics of the plates themselves. Major
geological events, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building, result from these plate motions. The crustal plates range in
thickness from a few to more than 100 kilometers. Ocean floors are the tops of thin oceanic plates that spread outward from mid-ocean rift
zones; land surfaces are the tops of thicker, less-dense continental plates. Earth is made up of 4 different layers: inner core, outer core, mantle,
crust. Seismologists have studied how wave energy travels through the different layers of Earth. Waves have characteristics: frequency,
wavelength, amplitude and speed. During an earthquake, energy is released into the Earth as: Primary waves, Secondary waves and Surface
waves.
6.E.2.3
Although weathered rock is the basic component of soil, the composition and texture of soil and its fertility and resistance to erosion are greatly
influenced by plant roots and debris, bacteria, fungi, worms, insects, rodents, and other organisms. The upper-most layer of the continental
crust is covered by soil. The ingredients in soils can vary from place to place and around the Earth. Different soils have many properties such
as texture, particle size, pH, fertility and ability to hold moisture. Depending upon the combination of properties, soils have great variability in

their ability to support structures and plant growth. Forces deep inside Earth and at the surface produce a slow cycle that builds, destroys, and
changes the rocks in the crust. Plate movements start the rock cycle by helping to form magma, the source of igneous rocks. Plate movements
also cause faulting, folding and other motions of the crust that help to form sedimentary and metamorphic rock. Minerals form as hot magma
cools inside the crust, or as lava hardens on the surface. When these liquids cool to a solid state, they form crystals. When elements and
compounds that are dissolved in water leave a solution, crystallization of minerals occurs. Soil is a mixture of: rock particles, minerals,
decayed organic matter, water and air. Soil forms as rock is broken down by weathering and mixes with other materials on the surface.
6.E.2.4
The environment may contain dangerous levels of substances that are harmful to human beings. Therefore, the good health of individuals
requires monitoring the soil, air, and water and taking steps to make these factors safe for all organisms. Evaluate ways in which human
activities have affected Earth’s pedosphere and the measures taken to control the impact: vegetative cover, agriculture such as (contour
plowing, conservation plowing), land use, nutrient balance (crop rotation), soil as a vector. Technology, such as remote sensing, has allowed
humans to better study the human impact on soil quality and erosional processes so that the soil can be protected and preserved. Over time,
remote sensing information can tell us how humans are constantly changing the surface of the Earth and what impact these changes are likely
to produce. Technologies can also assist in finding ways to help prevent erosion. It is important that humans be stewards of the pedosphere.

6.L.1.1
Animals and plants have a great variety of body plans and internal structures that contribute to their being able to make or find food and
reproduce. The process of sexual reproduction in flowering plants takes place in the flower, which is a complex structure made up of several
parts. Some parts of the flower are directly involved in fertilization and seed production. Other flower parts have functions in pollination. A
flower is made up of six parts: petals-are leaf like, usually colorful structures arranged in a circle around the top of a flower stem. Sepals are
modified leaves that encase the developing flower. They are sterile floral parts and may be either green or leaf like or composed of petal like
tissue. Inside the circle of petals are the stamens. A stamen is the male reproductive structure of a flower. At the tip of the stamen is the
anther. The anther produces pollen that contains sperm. At the center of the flower, attached to the top of the flower stem lie one or more
pistils. The pistil is the female structure of the flower. The bottom portion of the pistil enlarges to form the ovary, a structure with one or more
ovules, each containing one egg. When fertilization occurs the ovary grows into the fruit or vegetable. The length of night or dark period
controls flowering.
6.L.1.2
One of the most general distinctions among organisms is between plants, which use sunlight to make their own food (photosynthesis) and
animals, which consume energy-rich foods. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are complementary processes. Plants carry on
photosynthesis and cellular respiration where food is broken down into energy. The requirements of one process are the products of the other.

6.L.2.1
Food provides molecules that serve as fuel and building material for all organisms. Plants use the energy from light to make sugars from
carbon dioxide and water. Green plants are the producers of food that is used directly or indirectly by consumers. Plants can use the food they
make immediately or store it for later use. Energy flows through ecosystems in one direction, from the sun through producers to consumers to
decomposers. Matter is transferred from one organism to another and between organisms and their environments. Water, nitrogen, carbon
dioxide, and oxygen are substances cycled between the living and non-living environments. Investigate how decomposers return nutrients to
the environment—such as fungi on fallen logs, mold on bread. Explore the importance and role of bacteria in the guts of animals and plant
roots at it relates to the recycling of matter.

6.L.2.2
Changes in environmental conditions can affect the survival of individual organisms and entire species. Dormancy is a period of inactivity in a
mature seed prior to germination; seed remains dormant until conditions are favorable for growth and development of the new plant. Plants
have mechanisms that enable them to respond to their environment. Plants grow, reproduce, and shift the position of their roots, stems and
leaves in response to environmental conditions such as gravity, sunlight, temperature and day length. Tropism is a plant’s turning or bending
movement of an organism toward or away from an external stimulus such as light, heat or gravity. If the tropism is positive, the plant grows
toward the stimulus. If the tropism is negative, the plant grows away from the stimulus. This enhances the survival rate for that plant in a
given environment.
6.L.2.3
The world contains a wide diversity of physical conditions, which creates a wide variety of environments: freshwater, marine, forest, desert,
grasslands, mountain, and others. In any particular environment, the growth and survival of organisms depend on the physical conditions.
Environmental factors that affect an organism’s ability to survive in its environment, such as food availability, predators, and temperature, are
limiting factors. A limiting factor is any biotic or abiotic factor that restricts the existence, number, reproduction, or distribution of organisms.
For example, at high elevations, temperatures are too low, winds too strong and the soil too thin to support the growth of large trees.
Vegetation is limited to small, shallow-rooted plants, mosses, ferns and lichen. Factors that limit one population in a community may also have
an indirect effect on another population. For example, a lack of water could limit the growth of grass in a grassland, reducing the number of
seeds produced. The population of rabbits dependent on those seed for food will also be reduced and the hawks depending on the rabbits will
be reduced too as a result of a decrease in their food supply. Another factor for survive is the ability of an organism to withstand fluctuations in
biotic and abiotic environmental factors. The limits of an organism’s tolerance are reached when the organism receives too much or too little
of some environmental factor. Organisms become fewer as conditions move toward either extreme of the range of tolerance (too much or too
little).

        7.P.1.1 Explain how the motion of an object can be described by its position, direction of motion, and speed with respect to some other

What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
7.P.1.1
The motion of an object is always judged with respect to some other object or point. When an object changes position over time relative to a
reference point, the object is in motion. Motion can be described with a reference direction such as North, South, East, West, up or down. The
speed of an object is a measure of how quickly the object gets from one place to another.
7.P.1.2
An unbalanced force acting on an object changes its speed or direction of motion, or both. The change in motion (direction or speed) of an
object is proportional to the applied force and inversely proportional to the mass. All motion is relative to whatever frame of reference is
chosen, for there is no motionless frame from which to judge all motion. Friction is a force that opposes motion between two surfaces that are
in contact. The amount of friction depends on factors such as the roughness of the surfaces and the force pushing the surfaces together.
Newton’s law describes the relationship between gravitational force, mass, and distance. An object will not start moving until a force acts upon
it. An object will stay in motion forever unless an unbalanced force acts upon it. Inertia is the tendency of objects to resist any change in
motion. Likewise, inertia is the reason a moving object stays in motion with the same velocity unless a force changes its speed or direction or
both. Note: Newton’s Laws should not be memorized at this age. Rather, the principles which underpin the Laws ought to be well

7.P.1.3
When an object changes position over time relative to a reference point, the object is in motion. You can describe the direction of motion with
a reference direction such as north, south, east, west, up or down. Collect and organize data to show how the motion of an object changes in
position over a period of time. Communicate and graph data showing how the motion of an object changes in position over a period of time.
7.P.1.4
Students should collect and organize their own data for graphing distance versus time. Graphs for constant speed and variable motion.
Students will interpret prepared graphs for distance versus time for constant speed and variable motion.

Essential Standard and Clarifying Objectives

        model or diagram of a moving object (roller coaster, pendulum, or cars on ramps as examples).
        7.P.2.3 Recognize that energy can be transferred from one system to another when two objects push or pull on each other over a
        distance (work) and electrical circuits require a complete loop through which an electrical current can pass.

7.P.2.1
Mechanical energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion or its stored energy of position. Mechanical energy can be either
kinetic (energy of motion) or potential (energy of position). An object that possesses mechanical energy is able to do work. Mechanical
energy is the form involved in the operation of simple machines.
7.P.2.2
Objects that have potential energy do not use their energy until they move. That is why it is called “potential” energy. Potential means that
something is capable of becoming active. Any object that can move to a lower place has the potential to do work on the way down, such as a
marble rolling down a driveway. Objects also store energy in motion. A moving mass can certainly exert forces, as you would quickly observe
if someone ran into you during a basketball game. Energy of motion is called kinetic energy. Energy appears in different forms, such as
motion and heat. Energy can travel in different forms, such as light, sound or electricity. The workings of the universe plus all of present day
technology can be viewed from the perspective of energy flowing from one place to another and changing back and forth from one form to
another.
7.P.2.3
Energy can be transferred from one system to another (or from a system to its environment) in different ways: 1) thermally, when a warmer
object is in contact with a cooler one; 2) mechanically, when two objects push or pull on each other over a distance; 3) electrically, when an
electrical source such as a battery or generator is connected in a complete circuit to an electrical device; or 4) by electromagnetic waves.
Energy is one of the fundamental building blocks of our universe. Energy can change from one form to another, although in the process some
energy is always converted to heat. Some systems transform energy with less loss of heat than others. Electrical energy can be produced from
a variety of energy sources and can be transformed into almost any other form of energy. Batteries store energy and transfer energy to
components in a circuit. In the battery the energy comes from chemical reactions. Electricity is important because we can use it to make so
many things work (electrical energy). For example, a bulb converts electrical energy into light energy and a speaker converts it into sound
energy. The electrical energy generated by windmills, waterfalls and power plants is actually a secondary source of energy. To produce
electricity, a heat source is needed to create the conditions in which electrical currents form. In effect, the primary source of electrical energy is
the heat generated by burning fossil fuels, water power and wind power. A natural form of electrical energy can be seen in the lightning that
appears during storms. Solar energy, water and wind power are sources of green energy—meaning they do not pollute the environment. Note:
It is not necessary to investigate nuclear energy.

7.P.2.4
A machine is a device that makes work easier by changing the size or direction of a force. When you use a machine, you do the work on the
machine, and the machine does the work on something else. Mechanical advantage is the number of times the machine multiplies force. Ideal
Mechanical Advantage (IMA) is what is desired of a machine, where Actual Mechanical Advantage (AMA) is what the machine actually does.
A lever is a simple machine that has a bar that pivots at a fixed point called a fulcrum. A pulley is a simple machine that consists of a wheel
over which a rope, chain, or wire passes. A simple machine that consists of two circular objects of different sizes is known as a wheel and axle.
The mechanical advantage of a wheel and axle is the radius of the wheel divided by the radius of the axle. A simple machine that is a straight,
slanted surface, and facilitates the raising of loads is an inclined plane. A compound machine consists of two or more simple machines put
together. In fact, most machines are compound machines. Some examples are a pair of scissors and a bicycle.

7.E.1.1
The earth has a variety of climates, defined by average temperature, precipitation, humidity, air pressure, and wind, over time in a particular
place. The atmosphere is a mixture of gases, such as nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), argon (0.93%), carbon dioxide (0.04%), trace gases and
water vapor. The amount of each gas in the mixture is usually very constant from the surface of the planet up to the top of the troposphere.
These gases are constantly being used and renewed by the processes of respiration, photosynthesis, evaporation and condensation, the
weathering of rock, and the decay of organic matter. The atmosphere has different properties at different elevations and different locations
around the Earth. Air pressure, also known as atmospheric pressure, refers to the weight of the Earth’s atmosphere pressing down on
everything at the surface. Air pressure varies slightly over the Earth’s surface, and variations in pressure are responsible for the weather. Low
pressure is associated with storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes. High pressure is associated with clear and dry conditions. The air pressure is
less on the top of mountains (higher elevation) than in valleys. At the equator the atmosphere is warmer; at the poles it is cooler. The uneven
heating of land and water causes a rising and sinking of warm and cool air masses creating convection currents and causes winds. Five layers
make up the atmosphere: the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere. Each of these layers has very unique
properties. Weather occurs in the troposphere and is the physical condition of the atmosphere at a specific place at a specific time. Fronts,
global wind systems, atmospheric pressure changes and many other factors influence the weather. Major atmospheric activities such as
thunderstorms, tornadoes and hurricanes affect humans and can result in huge natural disasters. Air has weight. Air molecules are in constant
motion and are affected by gravity. The force of this movement causes air pressure. Air pressure changes with elevation. As you move up
into the atmosphere, the air molecules are further apart. So, air pressure decreases as distance above the surface increases. Air pressure also
decreases as the amount of water vapor in the air goes up. Since warm air is less dense than cool air, when temperatures are higher, the air
pressure is usually lower. Air pressure is measured with a mercury barometer (mm of mercury) or and aneroid barometer ( millibars-mb). The
atmosphere has constant change but strives to maintain equilibrium.

Water evaporates from the surface of the earth, rises and cools, condenses into rain or snow, and falls again to the surface. The water falling on
land collects in rivers and lakes, soil, and porous layers of rock, and much of it flows back into the oceans. The cycling of water in and out of
the atmosphere is a significant aspect of the weather patterns on Earth. Sunlight provides the energy that evaporates water from the surface of
Earth. Some of the water vapor comes from the continents, but most comes from the oceans. Winds carry the water vapor from the ocean over
the continents. Part of the water vapor condenses into clouds, then falls as rain or snow. Some of the rain returns to the ocean from rivers and
streams as runoff. Some seeps into the ground to become groundwater. Some returns to the air by evaporation from the ground or by
transpiration from plant leaves. When runoff from the continents returns to the ocean, one turn of the water cycle is completed. Other routes
are possible. For example, water that evaporates from the ocean can return to the ocean as rain. The water cycle never ends. The salt water of
the ocean supplies fresh water to the continents over and over again. Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a given time and place. A
complete description of the weather includes the amount and type of clouds. Rain, snow, thunderstorms, lightning, and even dust storms are
part of the weather. Measurements of temperature, air pressure, wind speed and direction, and the amount of moisture in the air are also
included in a description of the weather. Weather is studied and predicted by scientists called Meteorologists. The science of meteorology is
the study of the entire atmosphere, including the weather. To understand and predict the weather, meteorologist must first understand how the
atmosphere heats and cools, how clouds form and produce rain, and what makes the wind blow.
7.E.1.3
An air mass is a large section of the lower troposphere that has the same weather throughout. Air masses can form over continents, icecaps or
the ocean. Air masses are controlled by patterns of heating and cooling over large areas of the Earth’s surface. Changes in air pressure
readings indicate the passing of high and low pressure systems. Differences in air pressure cause Earth’s winds and weather changes. Storms
are natural disturbances in the atmosphere that involve air pressure, clouds, precipitation, and strong winds. The major types of storms are
thunderstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes, and winter storms. Each type has its own characteristics and dangers. Tornadoes are violently whirling
winds sometimes visible as a funnel-shaped cloud. They are produced by severe thunderstorms. Spiraling high winds and extremely low
pressure are the unique features of tornadoes. Thunderstorms are known as electrical storms. A thunderstorm is characterized by the presence
of lightning and thunder. They are produced rapidly when rising air causes cumulus clouds to build upward into a thunderhead. The cloud
type associated with thunderstorms are cumulonimbus. Thunderstorms are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain and sometimes
snow, hail or no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms are brief, intense storms that affect a small area. Hurricanes are huge, rotating storms that
form over the ocean near the equator. They produce very strong winds, heavy rains, and large, powerful waves and can cause severe flooding
and damage from strong winds. Floods occur when an area is inundated with water. Weather related flooding is most often associated with
hurricanes and thunderstorms. Winter storms are associated with quickly moving cold fronts and they can produce high winds, very low

The earth has a variety of climates, defined by average temperature, precipitation, humidity, air pressure, and wind, over time in a particular
place. Weather forecasting is an attempt to make accurate predictions of future weather. The accuracy of weather prediction is improving as
technology advances. A weather map is useful for making predictions. Weather maps usually show precipitation, wind direction, temperature,
cloud cover, high or low pressure, cold and warm fronts, stationary and occluded fronts. Weather systems generally move from west to east
across the USA. Long rang weather forecasting is more difficult than short-range weather predictions. Technologies such as computer,
satellite images and radar enable forecasters to track movements of large-scale weather systems like air masses and fronts. Weather data
collection results from using direct observations and measurements such as wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, humidity and air
pressure. Wind direction can be shown by flags or blowing dust. The actual wind speed can be estimated by observing its affects.
Temperature is a measure of the energy of molecules. The more energy the molecules in air have, the hotter it feels. Relative humidity
compares the actual amount of water vapor in the air with the maximum amount of water vapor the air can hold at that temperature (its
capacity). Differences in air pressure cause Earth’s winds and weather changes. Air pressure is simply the weight of the atmosphere per unit
area. Air pressure is directed equally in all directions. Clouds have three simple names: Cirrus, Stratus, and Cumulus. These three names
represent the three main cloud types. Cirrus clouds are high level clouds and due to high altitude, the water is almost frozen to form ice
crystals. If there are isolated Cirrus clouds, they do not indicate any instability in the weather and may not bring rain. However, if the clouds
are dense, they often indicate that a storm might be approaching. Both Stratus clouds and Cumulus clouds are low-level. Stratus clouds are
layered clouds that usually bring a drizzle and there is widespread rain and in some cases ocean air. Cumulus clouds are neutral weather
clouds. All the other clouds are combinations or variations of these types. Technology has greatly influenced the ease and accuracy of making
weather predictions. Weather data at thousands of locations can be gathered instantaneously and applied to weather prediction models to
produce weather maps. A cold front is the leading edge of a cooler air mass of air, replacing at ground level a warmer mass of air. The cooler,
denser air wedges under the less-dense warmer air, lifting it. The upward motion causes lowered pressure along the cold front and can cause
the formation of a narrow line of showers and thunderstorms when enough moisture is present. On weather maps, the surface position of the
cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spike pointing in the direction it is traveling. Cold fronts can move up to twice
as fast as warm front and can produce sharper changes in the weather. Cold fronts are usually associated with an area of high pressure. A
warm front is the leading edge of a warm air mass that displaces colder air, bringing a temperature increase and heavy rain where the front
makes contact with the ground. On a weather map a warm front is represented by a solid line with semicircles pointing towards the colder air
and in the direction of the movement. On a colored weather map, a warm front is drawn with a solid red line.

7.E.1.5
Thermal energy carried by ocean currents has a strong influence on climates around the world. Areas near oceans tend to have more moderate
temperatures than they would if they were farther inland but at the same latitude because water in the oceans can hold a large amount of
thermal energy. Changes in weather involve air movements, formation of clouds, and precipitation. Energy is needed to make all these things
happen. That energy comes from the sun. Convection is very important in moving heat through the atmosphere and the oceans. It transfers
heat from one place to another. All winds result from uneven heating of the atmosphere. An island, is surrounded by cool water. During the
day, the island heats faster than the water and so the air above the island becomes warmer. The molecules in the air become farther apart; so
the air expands upward and outward. This expansion lowers the air pressure at the island’s surface. The cooler ocean air moves in toward the
low-pressure area over the island. There is a pressure gradient between the ocean and the island. The wind moves form high to low pressure.
The speed of the wind depends on the pressure gradient. The lower the pressure (the hotter the island), the steeper the pressure gradient and the
stronger the wind. The pressure gradient provides the force that makes the wind blow. This force is called the pressure-gradient force. Wind
speeds are very high in the upper troposphere. It is here that the spectacular jet stream is found. Jet streams are a fairly narrow zone of very
strong winds in the upper troposphere. Jet streams are most common in the middle latitudes, so the winds in the jet streams are usually from
the west. Winds are also influenced by the Coriolis effect, which is due to the Earth rotating on its axis. Rather than flowing directly from
areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would on a non-rotating planet, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction
north of the equator, and to the left of this direction south of the equator. This effect is responsible for the rotation of large cyclones. The Gulf
Stream is a powerful, warm surface current in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is one of the strongest know currents. As the Gulf Stream reaches
Cape Hatteras, North Caroling the cold current that flows from the north separates it from the coast. When the warm Gulf Stream waters from
the south (Florida) combine with the cold winds a dense concentration of fog forms along with an immense heat transfer causing atmospheric
storms to intensify in this region.

Air quality affects the quality of life for all organisms on Earth. Natural and human activities greatly influence the quality of the air. The
environment may contain dangerous levels of substances that are harmful to human beings. Therefore, the good health of individuals requires
monitoring the soil, air, and water and taking steps to make them safe. Air quality affects the quality of life for all organisms on Earth. Natural
and human activities greatly influence the quality of the air. Technology has allowed us to measure the characteristics of the air and to monitor
how air quality changes. This information helps us to make informed decisions to protect air quality and risks to human health and other
organisms. The cumulative ecological effects of global ozone depletion, air pollution, increased particulate matter, acid rain, and global

warming concern the entire global community. Studies have shown that the human impact on these factors has impacted the global system.
Using less fossil fuel is the best way to improve air quality. Most forms of transportation and many industries produce carbon dioxide and add
particles to the air and reduce the quality of the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels is the major cause of air pollution. Smog is a colloid of
smoke, fog, and chemicals. Many areas have smog problems. Smog irritates the lungs. The burning of fossil fuels releases large amounts of
carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Some of these gases mix with water vapor and then form acid rain. Acid rain is harmful to both
living and non-living things. Natural events also release pollutants such as forest fires, volcanic eruptions and plant pollen. Because air
pollutants are often carried along by prevailing winds, acid rain may fall far from the source of pollution. Laws exist to help control and reduce
air pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides daily information about air quality. Local weather channels also issue
information related to the health of the atmosphere. Air pollution does not consist entirely of man-made substances. Many pollutants are
released directly from natural sources, and some pose as much of a health hazard as man-made substances. These “natural” pollutants include
radon, pollen and mold spores. Others are dust from plowed fields and volcanic eruptions. These eruptions could create situations where
planes could not fly.

Within cells, many of the basic functions of organisms—such as extracting energy from food, getting rid of waste, movement and secreting
waste—are carried out. The way in which cells function is similar in all living organisms. Even the simplest organisms have parts which
enable them to move, take in food, to reproduce and to detect the environment they are in. Euglena-moves by a flagellum, know for a unique
feature-- an eye spot, some contain chlorophyll and are common in fresh water. The amoeba moves by cytoplasmic streaming, surrounds food

Different body tissues and organs are made up of different kinds of cells. The cells in similar tissues and organs in other animals are similar to
those in human beings but differ somewhat from cells found in plants. Important levels of organization for structure and function include cells,
tissues, organs, organ systems, whole organisms and ecosystems. Specialized cells perform specialized functions in multi-cellular organisms.
Groups of specialized cells cooperate to form a tissue, such as muscle. Different tissues are in turn grouped together to form larger functional
units, called organs. Organs group together to form systems and systems group together to form organisms. Each type of cell, tissue, organ,
organ system has a distinct structure and functions that serve the organism as a whole.
7.L.1.4
To burn food for the release of energy stored in it, oxygen must be supplied to cells, and carbon dioxide removed. Lungs take in oxygen for the
combustion of food and eliminate the carbon dioxide produced. The urinary system disposes of dissolved waste molecules, the intestinal tract
removes solid wastes, and the skin and lungs aid in the transfer of thermal energy from the body. The circulatory system moves all these
substances to or from cells where they are needed or produced, responding to changing demands. The human body has a set of systems, which
regulate the internal environment and strive to give our cells the necessary conditions they need to function. These systems are made up of
organs; each organ system functions in the human body and works in cooperation with other systems to benefit the entire organism. The
skeletal system provides the support for movement and protection of internal organs. The muscular system creates the force that enables the
body to move and carry out different functions related to movement. The body’s circulatory, respiratory, digestive and urinary systems work in
combination to supply all cells with what they need to function properly and remove wastes. The reproductive system enables the organism to
make more of its kind. The immune system protects cells from microscopic invaders. The nervous system controls body processes by using
electrical impulses via a network of nerves. The endocrine system uses chemical messages called hormones, which are released into the blood
and regulate many bodily processes. The endocrine and nervous systems are two control systems that keep the body in balance (homeostasis).
Body systems work together in maintaining a constant internal environment. When the balance is disrupted, the body systems may not
function properly and human health can suffer.

7.L.2.1
In some kinds of organisms, all the genes come from a single parent. In organisms that have two sexes, typically half of the genes come from
each parent. In sexual reproduction, a single specialized cell from a female merges with a specialized cell from a male. Budding is a type of
asexual reproduction in which a cell or group of cells pinch off from the parent to form a new individual. Mitosis is a type of asexual
reproduction is when a nucleus undergoes cell division in which two daughter cells are formed, each containing a complete set of
chromosomes. Meiosis is a type of sexual reproduction. A form of cell division that allows offspring to have the same number of
chromosomes as their parent. This kind of cell division, which produces gametes (sex cell) containing half the number of chromosomes as a
parent’s body cell, is called meiosis. Fertilization is a type of sexual reproduction where there is a fusion of male (sperm) and female (egg) sex
cells. Genetics explains why you have inherited certain traits from your parents. If you understand how meiosis occurs, you can see how these
traits were passed on to you. A gene is a segment of DNA that controls the protein production and the cell cycle. Chromosomes are cell
structures that carry the genetic material that is copied and passed from generation to generation of cells. People have noticed for thousands of
years that family resemblances were inherited from generation to generation so characteristics that are inherited are called traits. A dominant
trait is an observable trait of an organism that masks the recessive form of a trait. A recessive trait of an organism can be masked by the
dominant form of a trait. Two organisms can look alike but have different underlying gene combinations. The way an organism looks and
behaves makes up its phenotype. The phenotype of a tall plant is tall, regardless of the genes it contains. The gene combination an organism
contains is known as it genotype. You cannot always know an organism’s genotype simply by looking at its phenotype. New varieties of

cultivated plants and domestic animals have resulted from selective breeding for particular traits. In sexual reproduction, a single specialized
cell from a female merges with a specialized cell from a male. In some kinds of organism, all the genes come from a single parent. In
organisms that have two sexes, typically half of the genes come from each parent. The fertilized egg cell, carrying genetic information from
each parent, multiplies to form the complete organism. Cultivated plants are plants that have been changed somewhat to promote survival in
different conditions due to intentional human activity. Agriculture, forestry and horticulture use these cultivated plants.
7.L.2.2
A pedigree is a diagram of family relationships that uses symbols to represent people and lines to represent genetic relationships. These
diagrams make it easier to visualize relationships within families. Pedigrees are often used to determine the mode of inheritance (dominate,
recessive, etc.) of genetic diseases. A Punnett Square is a chart wherein all possible gene combinations are shown in a cross of parents.
Reginald Punnett was an English Geneticist who discovered some very basic principles of genetics including the determination of sex and
linkage. His work involved using the color characteristics of a chicken’s feathers, efficiently separating the female gender of the chicken from
the male. In plants, a tall plant is considered dominant over a short plant. In using Punnett Squares, you can easily predict genotype and
phenotypes of any offspring.
7.L.2.3
Individual organisms with traits conducive to the environment’s stressors are more likely than others to survive and have offspring. Changes in
environmental conditions can affect the survival of individual organisms and entire species. Analysis of the patterns of genetic traits enhances
the understanding of genetic diseases and allows for predictions to be made by studying pedigrees. Some traits are inherited and others result
from interactions with the environment, life style choices, and environmental influence human characteristics that may or may not be passed on
to future generations. Some animal species are limited to a repertoire of genetically determined behaviors; other have more complex brains and
can learn and modify a wide variety of behaviors. All behavior is affected by both inheritance and experience. The length and quality of
human life are influenced by many factors, including sanitation, diet, medical care, sex, genes, environmental conditions, and personal health
behaviors. Faulty genes can cause body parts or systems to work poorly. Some genetic diseases appear only when an individual has inherited a
certain faulty gene from both parents.

What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
8.P.1.1
Students know:
    the structure of the atom:
            o that it is composed of extremely small particles that are too small to be seen with an optical microscope and that size at the
                atomic level is measured on the nanoscale.
            o that there are three basic particles in the atom (proton, neutron, and electron).
    that the atom is the basic building block of matter, that a single atom has mass and takes up space, and that all matter is composed
    of atoms. Students know that each of the elements has distinct properties and a distinct atomic structure. All forms of matter are composed
    of one or more of the elements. Students recognize that scientists have identified more than 100 elements that combine in a multitude of
    ways to produce compounds that make up all living and nonliving things.
    that an atom is the smallest unit of an element and that a compound is composed of two or more elements chemically combined.
    Students know that scientists identify and classify elements, compounds and mixtures according to their physical and chemical makeup.

                                                                                                                                            3
   the differences among elements, compounds and mixtures.
    Elements
            o Elements are pure substances that cannot be changed into simpler substances.
            o Elements are composed of one kind of atom.
   Compounds
            o Compounds are pure substances that are composed of two or more types of elements that are chemically combined.
            o Compounds can only be changed into simpler substances called elements through chemical changes
   Mixtures
            o Mixtures are physical combinations of two or more different substances that retain their own individual properties and are
                combined physically (mixed together).
            o Mixtures can be separated by physical means (filtration, sifting, or evaporation). Characteristic properties can be used to
                identify different materials and to separate a mixture into its components.
            o Mixtures may be heterogeneous or homogeneous.
                            In a heterogeneous mixture, which is not uniform throughout, the component substances can be visibly distinguished.
                            Tossed salad, granite, and iced tea are examples of heterogeneous mixtures.
                            In a homogeneous mixture, which is uniform throughout, the substances are evenly mixed and cannot be visibly
                            distinguished. Air, steel, clear salt-water are examples of homogeneous mixtures.
   that in solids the atoms are closely locked in position and can only vibrate; in liquids the atoms and molecules can collide with and
   move past one another; and in gases the atoms and molecules move independently, colliding frequently. The atoms or molecules of
   a solid form a pattern that minimizes the structural energy of the solid. At the melting point temperature, the atoms or molecules acquire
   enough energy to slide past one another so that the material, now a liquid, can flow. In a gas the atoms or molecules move about freely and
   collide randomly with the walls of a container and with each other. The distance between molecules in a gas is much larger than that in a
   solid or a liquid.
   that there is a relationship between phase and density and that density is mass per unit volume.
Teacher Notes:
   (1) It is not essential for students to understand isotopes or distinguish between covalent and ionic compounds.
   (2) Atoms interact to form molecules or crystals. The term molecule is used to describe particles of a pure covalent substance – element or
       compound. Examples are oxygen (O2), water (H2O), and sugar (C12H22O11) molecules. Crystalline solids can be metallic elements or
       ionic compounds. Examples are gold (Au), table salt (NaCl), and hematite (Fe2O3). These distinctions will be identified in high school
       courses.

8.P.1.2
Students know:
    how the periodic table of elements is organized and how to use the periodic table in order to obtain information about the atom of
    an element:
        o symbol
        o atomic number
        o atomic mass
        o state of matter at room temperature
        o number of outer energy level (valence) electrons.
    how the periodic table of elements is an arrangement of elements according to their properties. The periodic table of elements is
    arranged horizontally in order of increasing atomic number (number of protons) and vertically in columns of elements with similar
    c e ca          e e .  A   a         de ty is directly related to the number of protons in its nucleus. This information can be used to predict
    chemical reactivity.
    how to use the periodic table as a quick reference for associating the name and symbol of an element.
    how to find the atomic number and atomic mass of an element listed on the table. The periodic table of elements is also an
    arrangement of elements according to properties. The periodic table is both a tool and an organized arrangement of the elements that
    reveals the underlying atomic structure of the atoms. The periodic table is a tool that is used in all the domains of science.
    how groups of elements can be classified based on similar properties, including highly reactive metals, less reactive metals, highly
    reactive non-metals, less reactive non-metals, and some almost completely non-reactive gases. Students understand that substances are
    often placed in categories together if they react in similar ways. Examples of this in the periodic table include metals, nonmetals, and noble
    gases. Students know these are major groups of elements that have different physical properties.
    that the information that is organized in the periodic table is based on the observations of many scientists over a long period time.
    Dmitri Mendeleev is generally credited with the creation of the basis for our modern day table. Mendeleev was not the first to suggest a
    table, but he was the first to create one that predicted the existence of as-yet-undiscovered elements which were later discovered. As of
    2012, the periodic table contains 118 confirmed chemical elements, of which 114 have been recognized by the International Union of Pure

                                                                                                                                               5
    and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and named.
    that chemical symbols show the atoms of the elements composing a substance. Symbols are written with one, two, or three letters. The
    first letter is always capitalized. Each element has a different symbol.
         o Elements are made up of one kind of atom and the symbol for each element is unique.
         o Compounds are composed of more than one element and their formulas have more than one type of symbol showing the different
              elements that compose the compound.
    that chemical formulas are constructed from the symbols of the elements composing the substances.
         o In a chemical formula, the numbers as subscripts show how many of each kind of atom are in the compound.
         o The subscript is written to the lower right of the element symbol.
         o If no subscript is written, only one atom of that element is part of the compound. For example, in H2O, the number 2 is the
              subscript for hydrogen and means that there are 2 atoms of hydrogen in the compound of water; since there is no subscript for
              oxygen it is assumed to be one atom of oxygen.
    that atoms are composed of 3 subatomic particles- protons, neutrons and electrons. The thing that makes elements different is the
    number of electrons, protons, and neutrons. The protons and neutrons are always in the nucleus (center of the atom). The electrons are
    always found around the center in areas called orbitals. Protons have a "+" or positive charge. If the charge of an entire atom is "0", that
    means there are equal numbers of electrons and protons. Neutrons have a neutral charge (a charge of zero). Electrons have a "-" or negative
    charge.
Students should recognize common substances such as water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), sucrose (C12H22O11), table salt (NaCl), oxygen
(O2), household bleach (NaClO), hydrochloric acid (HCl), ammonia (NH3), baking soda (NaHCO3), and vinegar (HC2H3O2, 5% solution)
through chemical formulas and symbols.
Teacher Note: It is not essential for students to construct atomic models of subatomic particles. They do need to use visual representations and
concrete models of elements, compounds and mixtures.
8.P.1.3

                                                                                                                                         6
chemical properties (i.e., acidity, basicity, combustibility, and reactivity).
how to determine the identity of an unknown substance by comparing its properties to those of known substances.
how to compare physical changes (including changes in size, shape, and state) to chemical changes that are the result of chemical
reactions (including changes in color or temperature and formation of a precipitate or gas).
that matter can undergo physical and chemical changes. In physical changes, the chemical composition of the substances does not
change. In chemical changes, different substances are formed. Students know that when a substance is broken apart or when substances are
combined and at least one new substance is formed, a chemical reaction has occurred.
how to differentiate between physical and chemical properties:
    Physical properties can be observed and measured without changing the kind of matter being studied. The following physical
    properties can be used to help identify a substance:
    Melting Point
        o The temperature at which a solid can change to a liquid.
        o The temperature at which a pure substance melts is unchanging under constant conditions.
        o Therefore, the melting point of a pure substance can be used as a physical property for identification. Ice melts to form liquid
            water at 00C (32oF).
    Boiling Point
        o The temperature at which a liquid boils.
        o During the process of boiling a substance changes from a liquid to a gas.
        o Boiling begins when the liquid starts to form bubbles throughout, which grow larger, rise to the surface, and burst.
        o As long as the substance is boiling the temperature of the liquid remains constant (at the boiling point).
        o Boiling point is unchanging under constant conditions for a given substance and therefore can be used as a physical property for
            identification of the substance.
                                                                o         o
        o The boiling point for pure water at sea level is 100 C or 212 F.
    Density
        o Density is a property that describes the relationship between the mass of a material and its volume.
        o Substances that have higher densities contain more matter in a given volume.
        o The density of a substance will stay the same no matter how large or small the sample of the substance, and therefore, density
            can be used as a physical property for identification of the substance.
        o For example, the density of lead is much greater than the density of aluminum.

                                                                                                                                            7
   Color
       o   Color can be used to help identify a substance, along with other properties.
       o   By itself color is not a significant identifier of a substance.
       o   Absence of color is also a physical property.
   Chemical properties can also be used to help identify a substance. Chemical properties can be recognized only when substances react or
   do not react chemically with one another, that is, when they undergo a change in composition. A chemical property of one substance
   usually involves its ability to react or not react with another specific substance. Two examples of chemical properties include:
       o Reacting with Oxygen The ability of a substance to burn is a chemical property that involves a substance reacting quickly with
           oxygen to produce light and heat. Reacting with oxygen slowly occurs when iron rusts or apples turn brown.
       o Reacting with Acids The ability of a substance to react with an acid is a chemical property. Some metals react with various acids
           to form compounds. All metals do not react with all acids. Bases react with acids to form water and neutralize the acid.
how to differentiate between physical and chemical changes:
   Physical changes do not change the composition of a substance, only the physical properties. Evidences of a physical change include:
   Change in state of matter
           o When a substance changes from one state of matter to another (for example, changing from solid to liquid, from liquid to
               solid, or from liquid to gas), the composition of the substance remains the same.
           o Examples of change in state might include: melting of ice cream, hardening of melted wax, or evaporating of water from wet
               clothes.
           o When a substance changes directly from a gas to a solid (the forming of frost from water vapor) or from a solid to a gas (dry
               ice, solid air fresheners) that change of state is called sublimation. This is still a physical change because the composition of
               the substance remains the same.
   Change in size or shape
           o When a substance changes in size or shape (for example, cutting, tearing, dissolving, stretching, or wrinkling), its
               composition remains the same.
           o Examples of change in size or shape might include: shredding paper, dissolving sugar in water, stretching a rubber band,
               wadding up a piece of paper, or denting a piece of metal.
   Chemical changes result in the formation of one or more new substances with new chemical and physical properties. Evidences that a
   chemical change may have occurred include:
   Color change

                                                                                                                                            8
               o   When a substance changes color, the chemical composition of the substance may have changed (for example, iron turns to a
                   reddish-brown when it rusts, apples brown when they react with oxygen in the air, or marshmallows turn black when
                   burned).
               o It is possible to have a color change without a chemical change (for example, adding food coloring to water).
       Temperature change
               o When a substance is combined with another substance, there may be an increase or decrease in temperature (for example,
                   when wood burns to ash and gases, the temperature increases.
               o It is possible to have a temperature change without a chemical change (for example, warming of the water in a pond).
       Formation of a precipitate
               o When two solutions are combined, they may form a solid substance. This solid substance is called a precipitate and indicates
                   that a chemical change has occurred.
               o For example when carbon dioxide is combined with aqueous calcium hydroxide (limewater), solid calcium carbonate (chalk)
                   is formed as the precipitate.
               o The precipitate may be in the form of very small particles, appearing as cloudiness in the solution or as a solid which settles
                   to the bottom of the container.
       Formation of a gas
               o When solid or liquid substances are combined, they may form gas bubbles.
               o The formation of the gas may indicate that a chemical reaction has taken place. For example when vinegar is added to
                   baking soda, it forms carbon dioxide bubbles.
               o It is possible to form gas without a chemical change (for example, when water is heated to boiling).
Students know:
   that reactions occur at different rates, slow to fast, and that reaction rates can be changed by changing the concentration of
   reactants, the temperature, the surface areas of solids, and by using a catalyst.
   that many substances dissolve in water. Water is often called the universal solvent, because so many substances can dissolve in it.
   that solutions can be acidic, basic, or neutral. The pH scale is used to classify solutions. Neutral solutions have a pH of 7. Acids have a
   pH of less than 7. Bases have a pH of more than 7.
   how to distinguish acids and bases and use indicators (including litmus paper, pH paper, and phenolphthalein) to determine their
   relative pH.
   that a chemical equation can be used to represent a chemical reaction that has occurred. A chemical equation contains the chemical

    c b ed,  a d  ca   be   de        d  a    ea      e d       a e .    
           o Reactants are the substances broken apart or combined in a chemical reaction and that they are located on the left side of the
               arrow in a chemical equation.
           o Products are new substances formed in a chemical reaction and that they are located on the right side of the arrow in a chemical
               equation.
           o The amount of matter does not change during a chemical reaction, only that the atoms are rearranged to form new substances.
               This is evidenced in a balanced chemical equation.
8.P.1.4
Students know:
   that when materials react with each other, many changes can take place, but that in every case the total amount of matter
   afterward is the same as before.
   that a balanced chemical equation supports the law of conservation of matter.
   how to identify examples that support the law of conservation of matter and can explain the conservation of matter using the idea of
   atoms. In chemical reactions, the number of atoms stays the same no matter how they are arranged, and the mass of atoms does not change
   significantly in chemical reactions, so their total mass stays the same.
Teacher Note: Experiences using concrete models to simulate chemical changes will build conceptual understanding of conservation of matter.
Ask students to explain a chemical change identifying how products are formed from the atoms in the reactants.
Example: Hydrogen gas (H2) reacts with oxygen gas (O2) to form water (H2O).
One molecule of hydrogen has two atoms and one molecule of oxygen has two atoms. A molecule of water has one oxygen and two hydrogen
atoms. So, the two hydrogen atoms bond with one of the oxygen atoms to form a water molecule. There is an atom of oxygen left over, so
another hydrogen molecule is needed in order to make a second water molecule.
The balanced chemical equation would be 2H2 + O2         2H20. Two molecules of water are formed from four hydrogen and two oxygen atoms.

8.P.2.1
Students know:
    that all organisms on Earth, including humans, use energy derived from resources provided by the environment. Earth supplies a
    variety of natural resources that living things use, change, and reuse. Some of these resources can be replaced and/or reused in nature;
    these are renewable resources. Natural resources that cannot be replaced in nature are nonrenewable.
    that renewable resources are replaced through natural processes at a rate that is equal to or greater than the rate at which they are
    being used. Air, freshwater, soil, living things, and sunlight are renewable resources. Air can be cleaned and purified by plants during the
    proce                   e   a    e    e    e  ca b   d   de         e  a   a d   e ace             e .      T e   a e   c c e  a      Ea water to
    be used over and over within the environment. Topsoil is formed to replace soil that has been carried away by wind and water (although
    new soil forms very slowly). Trees and other new plants grow to replace those that have been cut down or died. Animals are born to
    replace animals that have died. Sunlight, or solar energy, is considered a renewable resource because it will continue to be available for
    billions of years. It provides a source of energy for all processes on Earth.
    that some resources are nonrenewable. Nonrenewable resources are exhaustible because they are being extracted and used at a much
    faster rate than the rate at which they were formed. Fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), diamonds, metals, and other minerals are
    nonrenewable. Fossil fuels exist in a fixed amount and can only be replaced by processes that take millions of years.
8.P.2.2
Students know:
    that natural resources can be depleted or used to the point that they are in effect no longer available. Conservation measures are
    necessary for nonrenewable resources because they are known to be in a non-replenishing supply. If renewable resources are used at an
    increasing rate so that they cannot be naturally replaced fast enough, they too can be depleted.

that freshwater can be depleted because of increased demands for water on account of population shifts. This results in water not
being available or not being sufficient to meet demands. Soil can be lost because it is left bare of vegetation and allowed to erode depletes
the land of the fertile topsoil needed for plant growth in that area. If living resources, such as trees, are removed without being replanted,
this can contribute to environmental changes in the land, air, and water in that area that leads to negative consequences.

          o The terms reduce, reuse, recycle are important ways that people can be involved in conservation of natural resources. Reducing
             involves making a decision to not use a resource when there is an alternative, such as walking or riding a bicycle rather than
             traveling in a car. Reusing involves finding a way to use a resource (or product from a resource) again without changing it or
             reprocessing it, such as washing a drinking glass rather than throwing away plastic or Styrofoam. Recycling involves
             reprocessing a resource (or product from a resource) so that the materials can be used again as another item, such as metals,
             glass or plastics being remade into new metal or glass products or into fibers.
          o Conservation involves preventing the loss of a resource by way of thoughtful management of it. Increased human consumption
             can have long-term consequences. Since the Industrial Revolution, human activities have resulted in major impacts on air,
             water, and soil. Pollution has cumulative ecological effects such as acid rain, global warming, or ozone depletion.

8.E.1.1
Students know:
     that water is one of the most common substances on the surface of the Earth. They know that water has unique properties that impact
    the role it plays on the Earth in all the spheres (hydrosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere). These properties include:
        o Polarity
        o Cohesion
        o Adhesion
        o High surface tension
        o Density
        o High specific heat

   Wa e   c e   a            a e   71%      e  Ea          ace (USGS). Most of this water (97%) is not drinkable because it is saltwater.
   The majority of freshwater (3%) exists in ice caps, glaciers, and oceans. 77% of the freshwater is frozen. Of the 23% that is not frozen,
   approximately a half of a percent is available to supply living organisms with what they need to survive. The availablilty of water varies
   with local geography and allows humans to utilize water as a resource.
   The ocean is salty because of dissolved chemicals eroded from the Earth's crust and washed into the sea. Solid and gaseous ejections from
   volcanoes, suspended particles swept to the ocean from the land by onshore winds, and materials dissolved from sediments deposited on the
   ocean floor have also contributed. Salinity in ocean waters is increased by evaporation or by freezing of sea ice and it is decreased as a
   result of rainfall, runoff, or the melting of ice. The average salinity of seawater is 35 parts per thousand. Salinities are much less than
   average in coastal waters, in the polar seas, and near the mouths of large rivers.
   Hydrothermal vents are recently-discovered features on the crest of oceanic ridges that release dissolved minerals into the oceans. These
   vents are the exit point on the ocean floor from which sea water that has seeped into the rocks of the oceanic crust (heated and containing
   dissolved materials from the crust) flows back into the ocean. This super-heated water brings large amounts of dissolved minerals with it.

Estimates of the amount of hydrothermal fluids now flowing from these vents show that the entire volume of the oceans could seep through
the oceanic crust in about 10 million years. Thus, this process has a very important effect on salinity.
that the ocean is an integral component of the world's climate due to its capacity to collect, drive and mix water, heat, and carbon
dioxide. The ocean can hold and circulate more water, heat and carbon dioxide than the atmosphere although the components of the Earth's
climate are constantly exchanged. Because the ocean can store so much heat, seasons occur later than they would and air above the ocean is
warmed. Heat energy stored in the ocean in one season will affect the climate almost an entire season later. The ocean and the atmosphere
work together to form complex weather phenomena like the North Atlantic Oscillation and El Niño. The many chemical cycles occurring
between the ocean and the atmosphere also influence the climate by controlling the amount of radiation released into ecosystems and our
environment. Air temperatures all over the world are regulated by the circulation of heat by the oceans. The ocean stores heat in the upper
two meters of the photic zone. This is because seawater has a very high density and specific heat and as a result can store vast quantities of
energy in the form of heat. The ocean can then buffer changes in temperature by storing heat and releasing heat. Evaporation cools ocean
water which cools the atmosphere. It is most noticeable near the equator and the effect decreases closer to the poles.
that the water cycle is the continuous movement of water in and around the Earth. The sun drives the entire water cycle and is
responsible for its two major components: condensation and evaporation. When the sun heats the surface of water, it evaporates and ends
up in the atmosphere as water vapor. It cools and rises, becoming clouds, which eventually condense into water droplets. Depending on the
temperature of the atmosphere and other conditions, the water precipitates as rain, sleet, hail or snow.
Some of this precipitation is captured by tree canopies and evaporates again into the atmosphere. The precipitation that falls to the ground
becomes runoff, which courses over the surface of the earth in streams. (Runoff also comes from snowmelt, which occurs when the sun
and climate changes melt snow and ice.) Runoff can accumulate and freeze into snow caps or glaciers. Runoff can also infiltrate the
ground and accumulate, becoming groundwater. Permeability is a measure of the ability of a rock or sediment to transmit water or other
liquids. Water does not pass through impermeable materials. A substantial amount of water is stored in permeable soil and rock
underground. An aquifer is a large deposit of groundwater that can be extracted and used. Finally, runoff makes its way back into lakes
and oceans, where it is again evaporated by the sun.
that a river basin is the portion of land drained by a river and its tributaries. It encompasses the entire land surface drained by the
various streams and creeks that flow downhill into one another, and eventually into one river. The final destination of the water drained by
a river basin is an estuary or an ocean. A river basin sends all the water falling on the surrounding land into a central river and out to the
sea.
that for land-dwellers, everyone lives in a river basin. Even if they do not live near the water, land-dwellers live on land that drains to a

    river or estuary or lake, and their actions on that land affect water quality and quantity far downstream. There are 17 river basins in North
    Carolina. The topography of each basin determines the area that it drains, and whether that water - from creeks, rivers, springs, and aquifers
    - flows into the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico.
8.E.1.2
Students know:
    that the ocean is a dynamic system in which many chemical, biological, and physical changes are taking place. The ocean is an
    important source of food and mineral resources as well as a venue for human recreation and transportation. Students know that the ocean
    is the largest reservoir of water on the surface of the Ea .  T e   a               a    e   cea       e   e   a e    e e            ea   a   Ea

    interior of continents. Many of the cycles that circulate materials between the atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere originate in the
    ocean. Ocean currents are a source of large scale distribution of energy and resources on the Earth.
    that estuaries are areas where fresh and salt water mix, producing variations in salinity and high biological activity. Estuaries trap
    nutrients and sediment that are carried from the land by rivers and from the ocean by tides. In an estuary, these nutrients are constantly
    being mixed, due to tidal action and river flow. These conditions create a fertile repository of plant and animal life. Estuaries are one of the
    most productive ecosystems on earth.
    Because estuarine waters are shallow (in North Carolina, less than thirty feet deep), sunlight penetrates to the bottom. This promotes plant
    growth. The rivers that feed estuaries deposit sediments rich in nutrients, which settle onto the sand and mud of the estuary floor. These
    conditions create unique habitats for both plants and animals, and provide the basis for great biological diversity in species (of fish, shrimp,
    crabs, clams and oysters) that are able to adapt to the brackish conditions. Estuaries are also good nurseries as they provide a protected
    environment for species to hatch and grow in before they migrate to the sea to live out their adult lives.
    Estuaries are numerous in North Carolina. The largest North Carolina estuary is Pamlico Sound. Water drains into this system from eastern
    North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, from the Chowan, Roanoke, Pasquotank, Pamlico, and Neuse Rivers, from marshes, swamps,
    forests, and grasslands. Estuaries help control erosion and reduce flooding of the mainland. Sand bars buffer the impact of waves, while
    plants and shellfish beds anchor the shore against tides. Swamps and marshes take the initial impact of high winds moving in from the
    ocean, soak up heavy rain and storm surges, and release the extra water gradually into rivers and groundwater supplies.
    Estuaries are a type of environmental filter. Plants and animals in estuaries filter pollutants out of the water. For instance, salt marsh plants
    trap some of the chemicals and pathogens carried by rivers and move them into soils where they can be neutralized. Oysters filter impurities
    out of water as they eat, collecting the contaminants in their bodies. One oyster can filter twenty-five gallons of water per day. Bacteria eat
    organic matter found in the sediment and in turn release carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfate and methane into the atmosphere preventing these

gases from being excessively stored up in the estuary. However, toxins can accumulate in estuaries causing many environmental and health
problems. Chemical pollution and sedimentation are great threats to the well-being of estuaries and oceans.
that from the seashore to the deepest depths, oceans are home to some of the most diverse life on Earth. Oceanographers divide the
ocean into zones according to how far down sunlight penetrates. Plants are found only in the sunlit zone where there is enough light for
photosynthesis, however, animals are found at all depths of the oceans. As far as we know, nearly all life in the ocean is dependent on
plants. Only plants have the ability to manufacture food out of inorganic substances. Algae in the ocean are an important food source as
well as an important source of atmospheric oxygen. The most abundant plants in the ocean are known as phytoplankton. To grow,
phytoplankton needs nutrients from sea water and an abundance of sunlight. Currents in the ocean recycle and circulate a variety of organic
and inorganic materials. This makes nutrients, minerals, and gases available to organisms.
that in the ocean there are innumerable individual food chains overlapping and intersecting to form complex food webs. Most
marine creatures eat a variety of foods. If one link in a chain is depleted, the other consumers in the chain have alternate food sources.
Ocean organisms generally belong to several different food chains that are linked to form a food web. Ocean food chains and webs are also
connected to land-dwelling organisms.
how winds have a powerful effect on the oceans and are an important force in creating ocean currents. From global circulation to
microscopic patterns of turbulence, winds move water and its resident animals and plants. Under certain conditions, a special kind of ocean
event known as upwelling can occur. Upwelling happens when warm surface water near coastal areas is blown offshore by winds. This
creates a condition in which the cold water along the bottom of the ocean near the shore rises, carrying sediment and organic material to the
surface. Phytoplankton uses these nutrients to grow and reproduce at a rapid rate. This attracts organisms that rely on the phytoplankton as
food and their consumers in turn. As a result, areas of upwelling tend to become areas of rich biological activity, providing resources to a
great diversity of ocean organisms. Approximately half of the fish caught in the world come from areas where there is upwelling.
that seawater has many different gases dissolved in it, especially nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide. The action of ocean wind and
waves agitates the ocean surface, stimulating the exchange of these gases between the ocean and the atmosphere. Marine plants depend on
dissolved carbon dioxide in order to perform photosynthesis. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into ocean water which is in turn used by
ocean organisms for respiration. Respiration releases energy from stored carbohydrates and produces carbon dioxide and water as
byproducts. Some properties of seawater affect how much gas can be dissolved in it:
    o Cold water holds more gas than warm water.
    o Seawater with low salinity holds more gas than high salinity water.
    o Deep water, which has a high pressure, holds more gas than shallow water.
that carbon dioxide is one of the most important gases that dissolve in the ocean. Some of it remains as dissolved gas, but most reacts

with the water to form carbonic acid or reacts with carbonates already in the water to form bicarbonates. This reaction removes dissolved
carbon dioxide from the water. Many marine organisms use the bicarbonate to form calcium carbonate shells. When these organisms die,
some of the bicarbonate is returned to the water, but a lot of it settles down to the sea bed. This process locks up, for long periods of time,
carbon that originated in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As atmospheric levels of gases rise, so do the levels of the same gases dissolved
in ocean water rise.
that the ocean is one of Earth's most valuable natural resources. Marine resources include biotic, mineral and energy resources. The
ocean provides food. It is used for travel and shipping. It provides a source of recreation for humans. It is mined for minerals and drilled
for crude oil.
The ocean plays a critical role in removing carbon from the atmosphere and providing oxygen. It regulates Earth's climate. The ocean is an
increasingly important source of biomedical organisms with potential for fighting disease. The ocean is very important to life on land.
 The oceans have been fished for thousands of years and are an integral part of human society. Fish have been important to the world
economy for a very long time. Fisheries today provide about 16% of the total world's protein with higher percentages occurring in
developing nations.
The word shipping refers to the activity of moving cargo with ships in between seaports. Wind-powered ships exist, but more often ships
are powered by steam turbine plants or diesel engines. The various types of ships include container ships, tankers, crude oil ships, chemical
ships, bulk carriers, cable layers, general cargo ships, ferries, gas and car carriers, tugboats, barges and dredgers.
Tourism is the fastest growing division of the world economy and is responsible for more than 200 million jobs all over the world. The
tourism industry is based on natural resources present in each country and tourism often has a negative impact on coastal and ocean
ecosystems. However, sustainable tourism can actually promote conservation of the environment. The negative effects of tourism
originate with the over development of coastal habitats and the annihilation of entire ecosystems. Garbage and sewage generated by natives
and visitors can add to an already existing solid waste and garbage disposal issue. Often visitors produce more waste than locals, and much
of it ends up as untreated sewage dumped in the ocean. This causes eutrophication because it results in excessive algal bloom. It can also
lead to disease epidemics. Ecotourism and cultural tourism are a new trend that favors low impact tourism and fosters a respect for local
cultures and ecosystems.
Humans began to mine the ocean floor for diamonds, gold, silver, metal ores like manganese nodules and gravel in the 1950's. Sands and
gravels are often mined for in the United States and are used to protect beaches and reduce the effects of erosion. Mining the ocean can be

devastating to natural ecosystems. Dredging of any kind pulls up the ocean floor and a cloud of sediment rises up in the water, interfering
with photosynthetic processes of phytoplankton and other marine life. Dredging also introduces previously benign heavy metals into the
ocean food chain.
Drilling for oil is another activity that extracts resources from the ocean. Before an offshore oil well can be drilled, it must first be located.
Geologists locate potential oil wells beneath the ocean floor through the use of magnetic and seismic surveys. This surveying does not
indicate for certain whether a site contains oil until exploratory drilling takes place. In order to drill exploratory wells, government
permission must first be obtained. An environmental impact assessment may be carried out at this stage. Then, using an exploratory drilling
rig, geologists drill temporary wells to find out if there's a source of oil. If they think they've found a good source of oil, then more drilling
takes place to substantiate the findings. Once oil or gas is discovered, then a production well is drilled and a production oil rig is built to
replace the exploratory drilling rig. An average well will last from ten to twenty years, and even after it has run dry an oil rig may still be
used for processing or storage of petroleum from other wells, so the production oil rig is built to last. The platforms are normally made of
steel and are secured to the seabed using concrete or metal foundations. Initially the pressure from the reservoir is enough to pump the oil
or gas, but as the pressure decreases various techniques are used to increase the pressure in the reservoir. These techniques include pumping
in gas, water, compressed air or steam. The crude oil obtained from the well is then refined at oil refineries onshore.
Drilling for oil under the ocean has many different environmental impacts. The rigs themselves impact living creatures, the actions and
processes of drilling affect the oceans and ocean life, and the danger of accidental release of petroleum into the oceans is constant.

that the deep ocean has long been of interest to scientists. In order to understand the ocean, scientists must gain access for themselves or
their instruments to very specific parts of it. Traditionally, scientists have used ships to photograph the depths, to drop floats and drifters
into the currents, and to collect samples of water, rock, and marine life. In recent years, the spectrum of available observing tools has
grown to include human-occupied submersibles, remote-controlled vehicles, and autonomous robots.
 At one time, scientists thought that life could not exist on the deep ocean floor. In 1977, scientists diving in Alvin to the Galápagos Rift
discovered a new community of organisms. These organisms can withstand tremendous pressure, high temperatures, utter darkness, and
toxic chemicals. These organisms are called extremophiles because of the extreme nature of their living conditions.
The discovery of life at vents and seeps revolutionized what scientists understand about how and where life can exist on Earth. The
organisms that thrive at deep-sea vents and seeps have to survive freezing cold, perpetual darkness, high-pressure, and toxic chemicals.

Hydrothermal vents and cold seeps are places where chemical-rich fluids emanate from the seafloor, often providing the energy to sustain
lush communities of life in some very harsh environments. Studying the organisms at hydrothermal vents and cold seeps expands our
understanding of how life first took hold and slowly evolved on our planet as well as where it might exist elsewhere in the solar system and
beyond.
On land and near the ocean surface, sunlight provides the energy that allows photosynthetic plants to convert carbon dioxide and water into
the organic carbon, the fundamental source of nutrients for animals higher up the food chain. Below the photic zone (the sunlit, upper
reaches of the ocean) many microbes have evolved chemosynthetic (instead of photosynthetic) processes that create organic matter by using
oxygen in seawater to oxidize hydrogen sulfide, methane, and other chemicals present in vent and seep fluids.
Animals such as clams, mussels, snails, and shrimp feed on the microbes, and in turn, provide food for fish and other predators. Some vent
and seep animals, such as tubeworms and shrimp, also host chemosynthetic microbes on or within their bodies, providing a place for the
microbes to live in exchange for nutrients produced by the microbes.
Cold seeps and hydrothermal vents differ from one another in the underlying conditions that form and drive them. This has implications for
the kinds of animals that are able to survive at each.
Hydrothermal vents are driven by heat from volcanism beneath the seafloor. In this environment, chemical reactions take place as seawater
percolates through cracks in the seafloor to produce hot (more than 400°C or 750°C), acidic fluids that eventually rise back to the seafloor.
Vents, and the ecosystems they support, are created and destroyed as underlying volcanic activity waxes and wanes over tens or hundreds
of years. On land and near the ocean surface, sunlight provides the energy that allows photosynthetic plants to convert carbon dioxide and
water into a fundamental source of nutrients for organisms in proximal food chains and webs. Below the photic zone many microbes have
evolved chemosynthetic (instead of photosynthetic) processes that create organic matter by using oxygen in seawater to oxidize hydrogen
sulfide, methane, and other chemicals present in vent and seep fluids. Animals such as clams, mussels, snails, and shrimp feed on the
microbes, and in turn, provide food for fish and other predators.
Cold seeps are a little bit different. They produce a diffuse flow of lower-temperature fluids, often composed of natural gas and a mixture
of hydrocarbons, at slower rates for longer periods. The methane seeping from the seafloor sustains microbes that serve as the base of the
food chain for communities of animals which thrive in the sunless depths. Far more natural gas is sequestered on the seafloor or leaking
from it than can be drilled from all the existing wells on Earth. Some seeps may be thousands of years old.

8.E.1. 3
Students know:
    that the health of a water system is determined by the balance between physical, chemical and biological variables. Physical
    variables include temperature, turbidity, and water movement. Chemical variables include dissolved oxygen and other gases, pH, nitrates,
    and salinity. Both natural and man-made forces are constantly changing these variables. Freshwater systems are of particular concern
    because they are the source of most of the potable water consumed by humans. Testing for the occurrence of chemicals and other factors
    that can influence water quality, such as nutrients and pesticides in water resources is a normal part of public health maintenance and
    stewardship of freshwater resources. Water that is safe to drink is called potable water, or drinking water, in contrast to safe water, which
    can be used for bathing or cleaning. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency sets maximum levels for the 90 most
    commonly occurring contaminants.
    that the temperature of water in rivers and lakes determines the kinds of organisms that can survive there. Particular aquatic
    species have preferred water temperature ranges within which they will live and thrive. Warm water dissolves more of a solid substance as
    it gets warmer, but it also dissolves less of important gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide. Very warm water may not contain enough
    dissolved oxygen for aquatic life to survive.
    that measuring dissolved oxygen is an important factor in determining water quality. Dissolved oxygen (commonly called DO,
    pronounced dee-oh) is oxygen that is dissolved in water. Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a measure of the amount of oxygen in water that is
    available for chemical reactions and for use by aquatic organisms. In the aquatic ecosystem, dissolved oxygen balance in water is important
    for the survival of certain microorganisms and higher organisms such as zooplankton and fish. Normally oxygen in water gets there
    through diffusion with the air and as a waste product of photosynthesis by aquatic plants. Dissolved oxygen in surface water is used by all
    forms of aquatic life; therefore, it is measured to assess the "health" of lakes and streams. Dissolved oxygen levels vary with seasons, and
    over 24 hour cycles. When dissolved oxygen levels in a body of water decline, sensitive animals may move away, weaken, or die. High
    DO levels in potable water usually make it taste better.
    that pH is a measure of how acidic or basic water is. pH is important because it controls many chemical and biological processes that
    occur in the water. pH is measured on a scale that ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 considered neutral. Values of pH less than 7 are acidic,
    while values higher than 7 are basic. The pH scale ranges from 0 (high concentration of positive hydrogen ions, strongly acidic) to 14
    (high concentration of negative hydroxide ions, strongly basic). In pure water the pH measures exactly 7. Students know that the pH of a
    body of water is important because pH has a synergistic effect. This means that the impact of other materials in a body of water - such as
    iron, aluminum, ammonia, or mercury - is amplified or diminished depending on the pH of the water. For example, when acidic waters

                                                                                                                                              21
    come into contact with certain chemicals and metals, it makes these chemicals and metals more poisonous than normal. This has special
    significance in water treatment processes, because specific water treatment processes require specific pH ranges.
    that nitrogen and phosphorous are essential plant nutrients. The nitrates and phosphates derived from them are chemicals that pose
    possible health risks to humans if their presence in drinking water is not controlled. The major sources of nitrates in surface water include
    runoff contaminated with fertilizers, septic tank leakage, sewage, and erosion of natural deposits. Phosphates, on the other hand, usually
    enter waterways from human and animal waste, laundry, cleaning and industrial effluents.
    that turbidity is a measure of how clear water is. The more suspended solids there are in a water sample, the less transparent it is.
    Turbidity is considered a good measure of water quality. In drinking water, high turbidity is generally not considered a favorable sign
    because it can be associated with organic pollution that might include pathogenic materials. In surface bodies of water, high turbidity can
    lead to increased water temperatures, low dissolved oxygen, and even physical impairment of aquatic organisms.
    that the water quality of a body of water can also be assessed by using bioindicators (macroinvertebrates). The presence, condition,
    and numbers of the types of fish, insects, algae, plants and other aquatic life provide accurate information about the health of freshwater,
    coastal and marine waters. Bioindicators include living macroinvertebrates. Macroinvertebrates are easy for people to collect and identify.
    Because many macroinvertebrates are sensitive to pollution in water, they are a good indicator of whether or not a body of water is livable.
    Good water quality is indicated by a variety of macroinvertebrates. Poor water quality is indicated by a few of one type of
    macroinvertebrates in one place.
8.E.1.4
Students know:
    that water quality is a term used to describe the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of water. Scientifically, an array of
    chemical, physical, and biological measurements is used to define water quality. Water quality is also described in terms of the purpose for
    which water is intended to be used. Water that is safe to drink is called potable water, or drinking water, in contrast to safe water, which
    can be used for bathing or cleaning. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency sets maximum levels for the 90 most
    commonly occurring contaminants.
    that water quality standards outline the water quality pollution control program that is mandated and regulated by local, regional
    and federal agencies. Standards outline the goals for a body of water by identifying its uses, establishing how to protect those uses and
    establishing provisions to protect and preserve the water bodies in the long term. Point and non-point environmental stressors such as urban
    and/or agricultural runoff, industrial inputs and over-fishing can impact a variety of aquatic and land-based populations. Because the water
    quality of a given water body is so closely linked to the surrounding environment and land use, monitoring and regulation at local, regional,

and national levels is important.
clear water may contain odorless, tasteless, and colorless harmful contaminants. Water must be tested for specific contaminants such
as bacteria, nitrates, arsenic and others. Natural supplies of potable water are very limited and do not exist in sufficient quantities to meet
human needs. Because of this, humans have developed water treatments that process water so that it can be used for a particular purpose.
Drinking water treatment requires some basic steps:
     o Water collection
     o Coagulation, during which lime and alum are added to the water, causing particulates to clump together.
     o Next, the water is shaken to form larger clumps, called flocs.
     o During the sedimentation process water stands for approximately 24 hours, which allows the clumps to settle to the bottom.
     o The water is then filtered, disinfected (usually with chlorine) and aerated.
The substances removed during the drinking water treatment process include suspended solids, bacteria, algae, viruses, fungi, minerals, and
chemical pollutants.
that water is essential to life. Water quality determines the sustenance of ecosystems, human activity such as agriculture, fishing, and
recreation, as well as public health of human societies. Water quality supports healthy environments in which rich and varied communities
of organisms can be found. The importance of monitoring and maintaining water quality cannot be overstated. Cultivating an awareness

8.E.2.1
Students know:
    that fossils provide important evidence of how life and environmental conditions have changed. The earth processes we see today,
    including erosion, movement of lithospheric plates, and changes in atmospheric composition, are similar to those that occurred in the past.

   that a fossil is the preserved remains or traces of an organism that lived in the past. Fossils give clues to the diversity of living things
   over the history of Earth, give clues to past climate and surface changes on Earth, and give clues to changes that have occurred with
   organisms over time.

        o Mold fossil – forms when sediments bury an organism and the sediments change into rock; the organism decays leaving a cavity in
            the shape of the organism.
        o Cast fossil – forms when a mold is filled with sand or mud that hardens into the shape of the organism.
        o Petrified fossil (permineralized fossil) – forms when minerals soak into the buried remains, replacing the remains, and changing
            them into rock.
        o Preserved fossil – forms when entire organisms or parts of organisms are prevented from decaying by being trapped in rock, ice, tar,
            or amber.

    o Carbonized fossil – forms when organisms or parts, like leaves, stems, flowers, fish, are pressed between layers of soft mud or clay
        that hardens squeezing almost all the decaying organism away leaving the carbon imprint in the rock.
    o Trace fossil – forms when the mud or sand hardens to stone where a footprint, trail, or burrow of an organism was left behind.
that  the  geologic  time  scale  is  a  record  of  the  major  events  and  diversity  of  life  forms  present  in  Earth s  history.    The geologic time
scale began when Earth was formed and goes on until the present. At the end of each era a mass extinction occurred, many kinds of
organisms died out, although there were other extinctions going on during each period of geologic time. Using the fossil record,
paleontologists have created an idea of the different types of common organisms in each geologic period.
    o Precambrian Era
                The Precambrian Era is Earth's first era of time. It began with the creation of the Earth around 4.6 billion years ago.
                5 major events occurred during this era: (1) the formation of the Sun and light, (2) the creation of the Earth, (3) the creation
                of the atmosphere through volcanic out-gassing, (4) the creation of the oceans, and (5) the creation of life.
                Began with simple life forms such as bacteria and simple algae.
                There was a rise of simple organisms such as jellyfish and sea worms by the end of the era.

                Early land plants included simple mosses, ferns, and then cone-bearing plants.
                By the end of the era, seed plants were common.
                The mass extinction that ended the era caused most marine invertebrates as well as amphibians to disappear.
    o Mesozoic Era
                Reptiles were the dominant animals of this era, including the various dinosaurs.
                Small mammals and birds also appeared.
                Toward the end of the era, flowering plants appeared and the kinds of mammals increased.
                The mass extinction that ended the era caused the dinosaurs to become extinct.
    o Cenozoic Era
                New mammals appeared while others became extinct.
                The diversity of life forms increased.
                Flowering plants became most common.
                Humans are also part of the most recent period of this era.

complexity of those life-forms also increases.
that millions of fossils have been collected and studied. The fossil record gives important information about past life and environments
on Earth. Certain fossilized organisms could only live in specific environments or under particular climate conditions. Extinction of life-
forms as well as how and when new life-forms appeared is part of the fossil record.
that the relative age means the age of one object compared to the age of another object. Relative age does not tell the exact age of an
object. The relative age of rocks and fossils can be determined using two basic methods: ordering of rock layers and index fossils:
    o Ordering of Rock Layers Scientists read the rock layers knowing that each layer is deposited on top of other layers. The law of
        superposition states that each rock layer is older than the one above it. This law is used to read rock layers. Using this
        understanding of layering, scientists infer that the relative age of the rock or fossil in the rock is older if farther down in the rock
        layers. Relative dating is best used when the rock layers have been preserved in their original sequence. Over millions of years,
        tectonic plate motion can distort these layers. As a result of this, the youngest layers of rock are not always found on top, because of
        folding, breaking, and uplift of layers.
    o   Index Fossils Certain fossils, called index fossils, can be used to help find the relative age of rock layers. To be an index fossil an

        fossil must be found over a wide area of Earth; the organism must be unique.
        The shorter time period a species lived, the better an index it is. A key example of an organism used as an index fossil are trilobites,
        a group of hard-shelled animals whose body had three sections, lived in shallow seas, and became extinct about 245 million years
        ago. Therefore, if a trilobite is found in a particular rock layer, it can be compared with trilobites from other layers to estimate the
        age of the layer in which it was found.
that geologists use radiometric dating to estimate how long ago rocks formed, and to infer the ages of fossils contained within those
rocks. The universe is full of naturally occurring radioactive elements. Radioactive atoms are inherently unstable; over time, radioactive

trapped inside. Afterwards, they decay at a predictable rate. By measuring the quantity of unstable atoms left in a rock and comparing it to
the quantity of stable daughter atoms in the rock, scientists can estimate the amount of time that has passed since that rock formed.
Absolute geologic dating and relative geologic dating are two methods by which scientists try to determine the age of geologic evidence.
Carbon-14 dating is an example of absolute dating, and the law of superposition is an example of relative dating.

   by examining the contents of different layers of sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rock layers can be disturbed by igneous rock. This
   happens when molten rock forces it way up through the layers above it. This forms igneous rock sections within and across the
   sedimentary layers. The sedimentary rock layers must be there first, therefore the igneous rock intrusions are younger than the layers it cuts
   through. Sometime the molten rock will force its way to the surface and erupt, creating a younger igneous layer at the surface. With time,
   more sedimentary layers can form on top of the igneous rock. Igneous rock is always younger than rock layers it cuts through.
   that  a  fault  is  a  break  in  the  rocks  that  make  up  the  Earth s  crust  that  is  formed  due  to  the movement of rock on either side of the
   fault. Generally, faults occur where there is movement (a slip) of tectonic plates. Sudden movement of this type is associated with
   earthquakes. Students know that the two main types of faults involve dip slips and strike slips. In a dip slip, two pieces of land change
   their vertical position compared to one another. Afterward, one side of the fault is higher than the other. In a strike slip, two pieces of land

What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
8.L.1.1
Students know that:
    microbiology as a basic science explores microscopic organisms including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, parasites, and some fungi and
    algae. These organisms lack tissue differentiation, are unicellular, and exhibit diversity of form and size.
    viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites may infect the human body and interfere with normal body functions. Some kinds of bacteria
    or fungi may infect the body to form colonies in preferred organs or tissues.
        o Viruses
                    Viruses are non-living particles composed of a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) and a protein coat.
                    Viruses need a host cell to reproduce.
                    Viruses invade healthy cells and use the enzymes and organelles of the host cell to make more viruses, usually killing those
                    cells in the process.
                    Viral diseases are among the most widespread illnesses in humans. These illnesses range from mild fevers to some forms of
                    cancer and include several other severe and fatal diseases. Transmission of these illnesses varies; some are transmitted by
                    human contact, while others are transmitted through water or an insect bite.
                    Vaccines and some anti-viral drugs are used to control and prevent the spread of viral diseases.
        o Bacteria
                    Bacteria are prokaryotic single-celled organisms.
                    Bacteria can live in a variety of places (with oxygen, without oxygen, extreme hot, extreme cold).
                    Bacteria reproduce through binary fission, a form of asexual reproduction. Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and
                    divide extremely rapidly, and bacterial populations can double very quickly.

                                                                                                                                                 28
                    Antibiotics are used to inhibit the growth of bacteria. Because antibiotics have been overused, many diseases that were once
                    easy to treat are becoming more difficult to treat. Antibiotic resistance in bacteria occurs when mutant bacteria survive an
                    antibiotic treatment and give rise to a resistant population.
        o Fungi
                    Fungi are eukaryotic, nonphotosynthetic organisms, and most are multicellular heterotrophs.
                    Most fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually (producing spores). This provides an adaptive advantage. When the
                    environment is favorable, rapid asexual reproduction ensures an increased spread of the species. During environmental
                    stress, sexual reproduction ensures genetic recombination, increasing the likelihood that offspring will be better adapted to
                    the new environmental conditions.
                    Fungi can sometimes attack the tissues of living plants and animals and cause disease. Fungal disease is a major concern for
                    humans because fungi attack not only us but also our food sources, making fungi competitors with humans for nutrients.
                    Mold spores can cause mild to serious allergies in some people. Billions of mold spores can become airborne and may then
                    be inhaled, triggering an allergic reaction.
        o Parasites
                    A parasite is an organism that feed on another individual, known as the host. They either live on or in their            b d .
                    Natural selection favors adaptations that allow a parasite to efficiently exploit its host. Parasites are usually specialized
                    anatomically and physiologically. Tapeworms are so specialized for a parasitic lifestyle that they do not even have a
                    digestive system. They live in the small intestine of their host and absorb nutrients directly through their skin.
                    Infectious disease may also be caused by animal parasites, which may take up residence in the intestines, bloodstream, or
                    tissues.
Teacher Note: It is not necessary for students to know specific diseases or disorders caused by microorganisms.
8.L.1.2
Students know that:
    a disease outbreak happens when a disease occurs in greater numbers than expected in a community or region, or during a season.
    An outbreak may occur in one community or even extend to several countries. It can last from days to years. Sometimes a single case of a
    contagious disease is considered an outbreak. This may be true if it is an unknown disease, is new to a community, or has been absent from
    a population for a long time. An outbreak can be considered as an epidemic or pandemic.
    epidemic and pandemic are similar terms that refer to the spread of infectious diseases among a population. There are two main
    differences between epidemic and pandemic. The term pandemic normally is used to indicate a far higher number of people affected than
    an epidemic. Pandemic also refers to a much larger region being affected. In the most extreme case, the entire global population would be
    affected by a pandemic.

                                                                                                                                             29
    the terms epidemic and pandemic usually refer to the rate of infection, the area that is affected or both. An epidemic is defined as an
    illness or health-related issue that is showing up in more cases than would normally be expected. It occurs when an infectious disease
    spreads rapidly to many people. In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic took the lives of nearly 800 people
    worldwide.
    in the case of a pandemic, even more of the population is affected than in an epidemic. A pandemic typically is in a widespread area
    (usually worldwide) rather than being confined to a particular location or region and affect global populations. An epidemic is not
    worldwide. For example, malaria can reach epidemic levels in regions of Africa but is not a threat globally. Whereas a flu strain can begin
    locally (epidemic) but eventually spread globally (pandemic). This is not unusual for a new virus, because if people have not been exposed
    to the virus before, their immune systems are not ready to fight it off, and more people become ill. Swine flu started in Mexico city where
    it was feared to lead to epidemic proportions in North America, now that the flu has been found in New Zealand, Israel, Scotland and many
    other countries, it has become pandemic. The 1918 Spanish flu and the Black Plague are extreme examples of pandemics. Keep in mind,
    though, that a pandemic doesn't necessarily mean millions of deaths-it means a geographically widespread epidemic.
    influenza pandemics have occurred more than once. Spanish influenza killed 40-50 million people in 1918. The Asian influenza killed
    2 million people in 1957. The Hong Kong influenza killed 1 million people in 1968. An influenza pandemic occurs when: A new subtype
    of virus arises. This means humans have little or no immunity to it; therefore, everyone is at risk. The virus spreads easily from person to
    person, such as through sneezing or coughing. The virus begins to cause serious illness worldwide. With past flu pandemics, the virus
    reached all parts of the globe within six to nine months. With the speed of air travel today, public health experts believe an influenza
    pandemic could spread much more quickly. A pandemic can occur in waves. And all parts of the world may not be affected at the same
    time.
Teacher Note: It is not necessary for students to know specific examples of epidemics and pandemics. Examples provided are for teaching
purposes only.

8.L.2.1
Students know that:
    technology is essential to science for such purposes as sample collection and treatment, measurement, data collection and storage,
    computation, and communication of information.
    traditional biotechnology was (and still is) the use of living organisms to solve problems and make useful products. Domesticating
    crop plants and farm animals through selective breeding, and using yeast to make bread rise and produce wine are examples of traditional
    biotechnology. New biotechnology involves the use of living cells and their molecules to solve problems and make useful products.
    biotechnology is not just one technology, but many. Biotechnology is a toolbox filled with many different kinds of living cells and their
    component molecules, and different ways to use them. Because there are millions of different species of plants, animals, and
    microorganisms in the world, each having cells and molecules with unique characteristics, there are a lot of potential tools in this toolbox.
    This is why biotechnology is so powerful and can be applied in so many different ways. There are three basic kinds of biotechnology tools:
    working with cells, working with proteins, and working with genes.
    many industries are finding uses for the new tools provided by biotechnology. The health care industry is developing better ways to

    of biotechnology applications is just beginning to emerge in energy and the environment, where living cells and their molecules can help us
    develop new methods to clean up our environment, detect environmental contamination, and reduce our dependence on petroleum.
    the microbial world has led to the emerging field of biotechnology which has given us many advances and new careers in medicine,
    agriculture, genetics, and food science. Biotechnology, while it has benefited North Carolina in many ways, has also raised many ethical
    issues for an informed community to consider. As we increase our knowledge and make advances in technology we are able to reduce the
    threat of microbial hazards.

biotechnology affects us in every area of our lives: our food, water, medicine and shelter. Uses of modern biotechnology include:
making medicine in large quantities (e.g. penicillin) and human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, combating crime through DNA testing
and forensic testing, removing pollution from soil and water (bioremediation), and improving the quality of agricultural crops and livestock
products. Some new areas such as Genetic Modification (GM) and cloning are controversial.

8.L.3.1
Students know that:
    ecosystems are complex, interactive systems that include both biological communities (biotic) and physical (abiotic) components of
    the environment. Organisms and populations of organisms are dependent on their environmental interactions both with living and
    nonliving factors. As with individual organisms, a hierarchal structure exists; groups of the same organisms (species) form populations,
    different populations interact to form communities, communities live within an ecosystem, and all of the ecosystems on Earth make up the
    biosphere. Like individual organisms, ecosystems are sustained by the continuous flow of energy.
    ecosystems are dynamic in nature; their characteristics can vary over time. Disruptions to any physical or biological component of an
    ecosystem can lead to shifts in all its populations. Biodiver   de c be    e   a e       ec e        d     Ea        e e a   a d   cea c

    a population is a group of organisms belonging to the same species that live in a particular area. Populations can be described based
    on their size, density, or distribution.
    population density measures the number of individual organisms living in a defined space. Regulation of a population is affected by
    limiting factors that include density-dependent, density-independent, abiotic and biotic factors.
        o Density-dependent factors Limiting factors that are density-dependent are those that operate more strongly on large populations
            than on small ones. Density-dependent limiting factors include competition (for food, water, shelter & space), predation, parasitism,
            and disease. These limiting factors are triggered by increases in population density (crowding).
        o Density-independent factors Limiting factors that are density-independent are those that occur regardless of how large the
            population is and reduce the size of all populations in the area in which they occur by the same proportion. Density-independent
            factors are mostly abiotic (such as weather changes), human activities (such as pollution), and natural disasters (such as fires).
        o Abiotic and biotic factors Limiting factors can change within an ecosystem and may affect a population.
                Abiotic factors are nonliving things in an ecosystem and may be chemical or physical. Some examples are water, nitrogen,
                oxygen, salinity, pH, soil nutrients and composition, temperature, amount of sunlight, and precipitation.
                Biotic factors include all of the living components of an ecosystem. Some examples are bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
            A change in an abiotic or biotic factor may decrease the size of a population if it cannot acclimate or adapt to or migrate from the
            change. A change may increase the size of a population if that change enhances its ability to survive, flourish or reproduce.
Teacher Note: It is not essential for students to calculate population growth patterns or population density.
8.L.3.2
Students know:
    that organisms in an ecosystem constantly interact. These interactions among the organisms:
        o generate stability within ecosystems.
        o can facilitate or restrain growth.
        o can enhance or limit the size of populations, maintaining the balance between available resources and those who consume them.
        o can change both biotic and abiotic characteristics of the environment.
    that an ecosystem is defined as a community (all the organisms in a given area) and the abiotic factors (such as water, soil, or
    climate) that affect them. A stable ecosystem is one where
        o the population numbers of each organism fluctuate at a predictable rate.

                                                                                                                                           34
    o the supply of resources in the physical environment fluctuates at a predictable rate.
    o energy flows through the ecosystem at a fairly constant rate over time.
These fluctuations in populations and resources ultimately result in a stable ecosystem.
Predation is an interaction between species in which one species (the predator) eats the other (the prey). This interaction helps regulate the
population within an ecosystem thereby causing it to become stable. Fluctuations in predator prey populations are predictable. At some
point the prey population grows so numerous that they are easy to find.
A graph of predator prey density over time shows how the cycle of fluctuations results in a stable ecosystem.
        As the prey population increases, the predator population increases.
        As the predator population increases, the prey population decreases.
that in any ecosystem, organisms and populations with similar requirements for food, water, oxygen, or other resources may
compete with each other for limited resources.
    Competition is a relationship that occurs when two or more organisms need the same resource at the same time. Competition can be
    among the members of the same or different species and usually occurs with organisms that share the same niche.
            An ecological niche refers to the role of an organism in its environment including type of food it eats, how it obtains its food and
            how it interacts with other organisms.
            Two species with identical ecological niches cannot coexist in the same habitat.
    Competition usually results in a decrease in the population of a species less adapted to compete for a particular resource.
    A symbiotic relationship exists between organisms of two different species that live together in direct contact. The balance of the
    ecosystem is adapted to the symbiotic relationship. If the population of one or other of the symbiotic organisms becomes unbalanced,

                                                                                                                                             35
        the populations of both organisms will fluctuate in an uncharacteristic manner. Symbiotic relationships include parasitism, mutualism,
        and commensalism.
                Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which one organism (the parasite) benefits at the expense of the other organism (the
                host). In general, the parasite does not kill the host.
                - Some parasites live within the host, such as tape worms, heartworms, or bacteria.
                - Some parasites feed on the external surface of a host, such as aphids, fleas, or mistletoe.
                - The parasite-host populations that have survived have been those where neither has a devastating effect on the other.
                - Parasitism that results in the rapid death of the host is devastating to both the parasite and the host populations. It is
                    important that the host survive and thrive long enough for the parasite to reproduce and spread.
                Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both organisms benefit. Because the two organisms work closely together, they
                help each other survive. For example,
                - bacteria, which have the ability to digest wood, live within the digestive tracts of termites;
                - plant roots provide food for fungi that break down nutrients the plant needs.
8.L.3.3
Students know that the sun is the ultimate source of energy.
        Energy entering ecosystems as sunlight is transferred by producers into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis.
        Energy then passes from organisms to organisms.
        Energy can change from one form to another in living things. Animals get energy from oxidizing their food, releasing some of its
        energy as heat.
        Almost all food energy comes originally from sunlight.
Students know that food provides molecules that serve as fuel and building material for all organisms. Plants, algae (including
phytoplankton), and many microorganisms use the energy in light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide and from the atmosphere and
water through the process of photosynthesis, which also releases oxygen. This food can be used immediately for fuel or materials or it may be
stored for later use. Animals obtain food from eating plants or eating other animals. Within individual organisms, food moves through a series
of chemical reactions in which it is broken down and rearranged to form new molecules, to support growth, or to release energy;. In most
animals and plants, oxygen reacts with carbon-containing molecules (sugars) to provide energy and produce waste carbon dioxide; anaerobic
bacteria achieve their energy needs in other chemical processes that do not require oxygen. Organisms that eat plants break down the plant
structures to produce the materials and energy they need to survive. Then they are consumed by other organisms.
Students know that over a long time, matter is transferred from one organism to another repeatedly and between organisms and their
physical environment. As in all material systems, the total amount of matter remains constant, even though its form and location change.

Students know that the flow of energy through ecosystems can be described and illustrated in food chains, food webs, and pyramids
(energy, number, and biomass). These are all models that demonstrate how matter and energy is transferred between producers (generally
plants and other organisms that engage in photosynthesis), consumers, and decomposers as the three groups interact- primarily for food- within
an ecosystem. Transfers of matter into and out of the physical environment occur at every level, for example when molecules from food react
with oxygen captured from the environment, the carbon dioxide and water thus produced are transferred back to the environment, and
ultimately so are waste products, such as fecal material. Decomposers recycle nutrients from dead plant or animal matter back to the soil in
terrestrial environments or to the water in aquatic environments. The atoms that make up the organisms in an ecosystem are cycled repeatedly
between the living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem.
Students know how the flow of energy is interconnected with the cycling of matter.
    A food chain is the simplest path that energy takes through an ecosystem. Energy enters an ecosystem from the Sun. Each level in the
    transfer of energy through an ecosystem is called a trophic level. The organisms in each trophic level use some of the energy in the process
    of cellular respiration, lose energy due to heat loss, and store the rest.
    o The first trophic level consists of producers (green plants or other autotrophs).
                 P a    d ce   ca          e   e  S      e e   d                  e ,  a d        c e ed     c e ca   e e       e                e
                 sugars.
                 The autotroph uses some of the simple sugars for energy and some of the simple sugars are converted to organic compounds
                 (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) as needed for the structure and functions of the organism.
                 Examples of primary producers include land plants and phytoplankton in aquatic environments.
    o The second trophic level consists of primary consumers (heterotrophs).
                 Primary consumers that eat green plants are called herbivores.
                 The herbivore uses some of the organic compounds for energy and some of the organic compounds are converted into the
                 proteins, carbohydrates and fats that are necessary for the structure and functions of the herbivore. Much of the consumed
                 energy is lost as heat.
                 Examples of primary consumers include grasshoppers, rabbits and zooplankton.
    o The third trophic level, or any higher trophic level, consists of consumers.
                 Consumers that eat primary consumers are called carnivores; consumers that eat both producers and primary consumers are
                 called omnivores.
                 The carnivores or omnivores use some of the organic compounds for energy and some of the organic compounds are converted
                 into the proteins, carbohydrates and fats that are necessary for their body structures and functions. Much of the consumed
                 energy is lost as heat.
                 Examples of consumers include humans, wolves, frogs, and minnows.

o A heterotroph that breaks down organic material and returns the nutrients to soil, water, and air making the nutrients available to other
    organisms is called a decomposer.
o The energy available for each trophic level in an ecosystem can be illustrated with a food chain diagram.
A food web represents many interconnected food chains describing the various paths that energy takes through an ecosystem. The energy
available in an ecosystem can be illustrated with a food web diagram.
Ecological pyramids are models that show how energy flows through ecosystems. Pyramids can show the relative amounts of energy,
biomass, or numbers of organisms at each trophic level in an ecosystem. The base of the pyramid represents producers. Each step up
represents a different level of consumer. The number of trophic levels in the pyramid is determined by the number of organisms in the food
chain or food web.
    o An energy pyramid represents the energy available for each trophic level in an ecosystem.
                The energy needs of organisms are greater from level to level in an ecosystem.
                Therefore, the total amount of energy available at each level decreases in an ecosystem.
                Each successive level in an ecosystem can support fewer numbers of organisms than the one below. With each level of the
                pyramid, only 10% of the energy available is used by organisms while there is an energy loss of about 90% to the
                environment.
    o A number pyramid represents the number of individual organisms available for energy at each trophic level in an ecosystem. It can
        be used to examine how the population of a certain species affects another.
                The autotrophic level is represented at the base of the pyramid. This represents the total number of producers available to
                support the energy needs of the ecosystem.
                The total numbers of individual organisms tend to decline as one goes up trophic levels.
    o A biomass pyramid represents the total mass of living organic matter (biomass) at each trophic level in an ecosystem.
                Since the number of organisms is reduced in each successive trophic level, the biomass at each trophic level is reduced as
                well.
                Even though a biomass pyramid shows the total mass of organisms available at each level, it does not necessarily represent
                the amount of energy available at each level. For example, the skeleton and beak of a bird will contribute to the total
                biomass but are not available for energy.

    the evidence that organisms and landforms change over time is scientifically described using the Theory of Evolution, the Plate Tectonics
    Theory, and the Law of Superposition.
    biological evolution accounts for the diversity of species developed through gradual processes over many generations. Species
    acquire many of their unique characteristics through biological adaptation, which involves the selection of naturally occurring variations in
    populations. Biological adaptations include changes in structures, behaviors, or physiology that enhance survival and reproductive success
    in a particular environment. Similarities among organisms can infer the degree of relatedness: homologous structures anatomical and
    cellular, analogous structures--anatomical and cellular, embryological similarities anatomical and cellular, human developmental patterns
    are similar to those of other vertebrates.
    fossils (mineral replacements, preserved or traces of organisms that lived in the past) can be compared to one another and to living
    organisms according to their similarities and differences. Many thousands of layers of sedimentary rock provide evidence for the long
    history of the earth and for the long history of changing life forms whose remains are found in the rocks. Sediments, sand and smaller
    particles (sometimes containing the remains of organisms) are gradually buried and cemented together to form solid rock again. More
    recently deposited rock layers are more likely to contain fossils resembling existing species. Thousands of layers of sedimentary rock not
    only provide evidence of the history of Earth itself, but also of changes in organisms whose fossil remains have been found in these layers.

    found or through radioactive dating) is known as the fossil record. It documents the existence, diversity, extinction, and change of many
    life forms throughout the history of life in Earth. Because of the conditions necessary for their preservation, not all types of organisms that
    existed in the past have left fossils that can be retrieved. Anatomical similarities and differences between various organisms living today
    and between them and organisms in the fossil record enable the reconstruction of evolutionary history and the inference of lines of
    evolutionary descent.
    most species that have lived on the earth are now extinct. Extinction of species is common. Extinction of species occurs when the
    environment changes and the individual organisms of that species do not have the traits necessary to survive and reproduce in the changed
    environment. Some organisms that lived long ago are similar to existing organisms, but some are quite different. Extinction of organisms is
    apparent in the fossil record.
    biological classification is a system which is used to organize and codify all life on Earth. There are a number of goals to biological
    classification, in addition to the obvious need to be able to precisely describe organisms. Creating a system of classification allows
    scientists to examine the relationships between various organisms, and to construct evolutionary trees to explore the origins of life on Earth
    and the relationship of modern organisms to historical examples. Biological classification is also referred to as taxonomy. Comparison of
    the embryological development of different species also reveals similarities that show relationships not evident in the fully formed
    anatomy.
Theory of Evolution: The theory states that species change over time. Living things evolve in response to changes in their environment.

descended from a common ancestor. As random genetic mutations occur within an organism's genetic code, the beneficial mutations are
preserved because they aid survival -- a process known as natural selection. These beneficial mutations are passed on to the next generation.
Over time, beneficial mutations accumulate and the result is an entirely different organism (not just a variation of the original, but an entirely
different creature).

contracted continental shelves, created and destroyed inland seas and shaped the surface of land. Sea level changes as plate tectonics cause the
volume of the oceans and the height of land to change, as ice caps on land melt or enlarge and/or as sea water expands when ocean water
warms and cools. The processes responsible for changes we observe today are similar to the processes that have occurred throu                          Ea

8.L.4.2
Students know that:
        within every population, variation exists within the inherited traits of the individuals. Variation exists in the phenotypes (body
        structures and characteristics) of the individuals within every population. A    a               e         e   a        e ce     ab           d,

        in any particular environment, the growth and survival of organisms depend on physical conditions. Changes in environmental
        conditions can affect the survival of individual organisms and entire species. If an environment changes, organisms that have
        characteristics which are well-suited to the new environment will be able to survive and reproduce at higher rates than those with less
        favorable traits. Therefore, the alleles associated with favorable phenotypes increase in frequency and become more common and
        increase the chances of survival of the species.
        individual  organisms  with  certain  traits  (those  that  are  “favored”  in  the  environment)  are  more  likely  than  others  to  survive,
        reproduce  and  pass  these  “favorable”  traits  (such  as courting behaviors, coloration or odors in plants and animals, competitive
        strength) to their offspring. Those organisms that do not interact well with the environment are more likely to die or produce fewer

        within a species there is a variability of phenotypic traits leading to diversity among the organisms of the species. The greater
        the diversity, the greater the chances are for that species to survive during environmental changes.

What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
8.L.5.1
Students know that:
    food provides molecules that serve as fuel and building material for all organisms. Plants use the energy in light to make sugars out of
    carbon dioxide and water. This food can be used immediately for fuel or materials or it may be stored for later use. Organisms that eat
    plants break down the plant structures to produce the materials and energy they need to survive. Then they are consumed by other
    organisms.
    cells carry on the many functions needed to sustain life. They grow and divide (mitosis or meiosis), thereby producing more cells. This
    requires that they take in nutrients, which they use to provide energy for the work that cells do and to make the materials that a cell or an
    organism needs. The way in which all cells function is similar in all living organisms. Within cells many of the basic functions of
    organisms, such as releasing energy from food and getting rid of waste, are carried out by different cell elements.
    matter is transferred among organisms in an ecosystem when organisms eat, or are eaten by others for food. Matter is transferred
    from organisms to the physical environment when molecules from food react with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water in a process
    called cellular respiration. Through the process of cellular respiration, cells convert energy (glucose) to a usable form of energy (ATP). The
    energy stored in ATP provides the means by which cells are able to carry out their functions such as growth, development, and repair of
    organisms, locomotion and transportation of molecules across cell membranes.
    in plants and animals, molecules from food (a) react with oxygen to provide energy that is needed to carry out life functions, (b)

    build and become incorporated into the body structure, or (c) are stored for later use. (Also in Matter and Energy)
   matter moves within individual organisms through a series of chemical reactions in which food is broken down and rearranged to
   form new molecules.
   plants use the energy from light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide and water. This process transforms light energy from
   the sun into stored chemical energy.
   minerals  and  other  nutrients  from  the  soil  are  not  food  (they  don t  provide  energy),  but  they  are  needed  for  plants  to  make  complex
   molecules from the sugar they make.
    chemical energy is transferred from one organism in an ecosystem to another as the organisms interact with each other for food.
    the atoms that make up the organisms in an ecosystem are cycled repeatedly between the living and nonliving parts of the
    ecosystem. Over a long time, matter is transferred from one organism to another repeatedly and between organisms and their physical
    environment. As in all material systems, the total amount of matter remains constant, even though its form and location change.
    energy can change from one form to another in living things. Animals get energy from oxidizing their food, releasing some of its
    energy as heat. Almost all food energy comes originally from sunlight.
Teacher Notes:
1) The term food is commonly known as whatever nutrients plants and animals must take in if they are to grow and survive. In scientific
    terms, food refers only to those substances, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids, from which organisms derive the energy they need
    to grow and operate and the material of which they are made. It is also important to emphasize that the sugars that plants make out of water
    and carbon dioxide are their only source of food. Water and minerals dissolved in it are not sources of energy for plants or for animals.
2) It is not essential for students to know the structural components of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates.

total energy used by an individual depends on the type and intensity of the activity and the energy required for basic life processes. The
amount of energy required to maintain minimum essential life functions is called basal metabolic rate, or BMR. Humans obtain the energy
required to carry out basic life processes from the food they consume. Food energy is measured in calories. The amount of food energy
(calories) a person requires varies with body weight, age, sex, activity level, and natural body efficiency.
For the body to use food (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates) for energy and building materials, the food must first be digested into
molecules that are absorbed and transported to cells.
Metabolism is the set of chemical reactions involved in storing fuel (food) molecules and converting fuel (food) molecules into
energy. In order for the body to use the fuel energy stored in food, the food must first be digested and combined with oxygen (oxidized).
Three factors contribute to the overall metabolic rate of the body. The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) accounts for about 60% of all
energy used by the body. Daily physical activities such as walking and moving around account for another 30% of the energy used by the
body. Finally, 10% of the energy used by the body is used to digest and process (oxidize) food.
If one consumes more calories than the body uses, the excess is stored and weight is gained. Weight loss occurs when fewer calories
are taken in than the body needs.
To burn food for the release of energy stored in it, oxygen must be supplied to cells, and carbon dioxide removed. The heart /lung
system work together to deliver oxygen rich blood to all of the organs, tissues and cells of the body. Lungs take in oxygen for the
combustion of food and they eliminate the carbon dioxide produced. The circulatory system moves all these substances to or from cells
where they are needed or produced, responding to changing demands.
In order for systems to work properly, energy from the cells must be transformed into a useable form for cells and ultimately,
organs, to perform work. These systems work together in order for the body to function properly and maintain a balance. Regular
exercise is important to maintain a healthy heart/lung system, good muscle tone, and bone strength. Regular exercise and physical activity
increases the heart rate providing more oxygen for the body to use for processing food. A healthy body requires a delicate balance between
a healthy diet and physical activity.
In order for energy balance to occur, Energy In = Energy Out. This means that caloric intake equals caloric output. Food components
(protein, fat, and carbohydrate) taken into the body have the following fates: they can be used to fuel metabolic activities and physical

   There are two important concepts of energy balance for adolescents. First, to allow for normal body growth, more food energy
   must be consumed than can be accounted for solely on the basis of energy required for metabolic and physical activities. Second,
   insufficient energy intake may affect cellular metabolic activities, body weight, growth, tissue formation, and health.
Teacher Note: It is not essential for students to know how to calculate calories and BMI or to know the USDA food pyramid/plate.

      This document is designed to help North Carolina educators teach the Essential Standards (Standard Course of Study). NCDPI staff
      are continually updating and improving these tools to better serve teachers.
Essential Standards: Kindergarten Science
For the Essential Standards that will be effective in all North Carolina schools in the 2012-13 school year.
  What is the purpose of this document?
  To increase student achievement by ensuring educators understand specifically what the new standards mean a student must know, understand and be
  able to do.
  What is in the document?
  Descriptions of what each standard means a student will know, understand and be able to do. The “unpacking” of the standards done in this document is
  an effort to answer a simple question “What does this standard mean that a student must know and be able to do?” and to ensure the description is
  helpful, specific and comprehensive for educators.
  How do I send Feedback?
  We intend the explanations and examples in this document to be helpful and specific. That said, we believe that as this document is used, teachers and
  educators will find ways in which the unpacking can be improved and made ever more useful. Please send feedback to us at feedback@dpi.state.nc.us
  and we will use your input to refine our unpacking of the standards. Thank You!
  Just want the standards alone?

Essential Standard and Clarifying Objectives
K.P.1 Understand the positions and motions of objects and organisms observed in the environment.
       K.P.1.1 Compare the relative position of various objects observed in the classroom and outside using position words such as: in front of,
       behind, between, on top of, under, above, below and beside.
       K.P.1.2 Give examples of different ways objects and organisms move (to include falling to the ground when dropped ):

Unpacking
What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
K.P.1.1
Students know that their senses are used to make observations and learn about their environment. Students know that the position of an object
can be described by locating the object relative to another object, fixed point, or background. Students know the difference between words
used to describe the location of an object such as: (in front of, behind, between, on top of, under, above, below, beside) and can communicate
using oral language so that all observers can agree on the position of an object in relation to another object.
K.P.1.2
Students know the various ways that living and nonliving things can move, to include falling to the ground when dropped unless something
holds them up. Students know that earth pulls down on all objects. Students know how to observe, describe, and discuss all kinds of moving
things—themselves, insects, birds, trees, doors, rain, fans, swings, volleyballs, wagons, etc.—keeping notes, drawing pictures to suggest their
motion. Students know how to raise questions about the movement of various organisms to include: Do they move in a straight line or zigzag?

                                              Matter: Properties and Change
Essential Standard and Clarifying Objectives
K.P.2 Understand how objects are described based on their physical properties and how they are used.
        K.P.2.1 Classify objects by observable physical properties (including size, color, shape, texture, weight and flexibility).
        K.P.2.2 Compare the observable physical properties of different kinds of materials (clay, wood, cloth, paper, etc) from which objects are
        made and how they are used.
Unpacking
What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
K.P.2.1
Students know objects and substances have properties. Students know objects can be described in terms of the materials they are made of (e.g.,
clay, cloth, paper) and their physical properties (e.g., color, size, shape, weight, texture, flexibility, magnetic attraction, floating or sinking in
water). Students know some materials, such as clay and wood, make things hard and sturdy which helps to determine how they are used.
Other materials such as cloth and paper make things flexible which gives them a different use compared to things that are hard.
K.P.2.2
Students know objects may be sorted based on a list of observable properties such as size, color, shape, texture, weight, and flexibility.

                                     Earth Systems, Structures and Processes
Essential Standard and Clarifying Objectives
K.E.1 Understand change and observable patterns of weather that occur from day to day and throughout the year.
        K.E.1.1 Infer that change is something that happens to many things in the environment based on observations made using one or more
        of their senses.
        K.E.1.2 Summarize daily weather conditions noting changes that occur from day to day and throughout the year.
        K.E.1.3 Compare weather patterns that occur from season to season.
Unpacking
What does this standard mean a child will know, understand and be able to do?
K.E.1.1
Students know how to use observation skills to note characteristics of their environment on a daily basis. Students know that the weather may
be sunny one day and cloudy another day. Students know how to compare their observations and describe how each observation is similar to
or different from a previous observation.
K.E.1.2
Students know that weather changes from day to day. Students know how to maintain a daily weather journal and describe how the weather
changes daily.
K.E.1.3
Students build on the concept that change is something that happens to many things in the environment to include weather. Change can happen
quickly or slowly. By observing daily weather changes, students can infer patterns that occur from season to season. Some weather patterns
include sunny days, rainy days, windy or cloudy days, snowy days and stormy days. Students compare the weather patterns associated with
each season: winter, spring, summer and fall (autumn). Students know seasons occur in a particular order and therefore the weather patterns
associated with seasons occur in a particular order.

                                Structures and Functions of Living Organisms
Essential Standard and Clarifying Objectives
K.L.1 Compare characteristics of animals that make them alike and different from other animals and nonliving
things.
        K.L.1.1 Compare different types of the same animal (i.e. different types of dogs, different types of cats, etc.) to determine individual
        differences within a particular type of animal.
        K.L.1.2 Compare characteristics of living and nonliving things in terms of their:
                Structure
                Growth

K.L.1.1
Students know that animals of the same type (i.e. dogs-spaniels/shepherds, cats- solids/tabby, birds-hawk/sparrow, etc.) have individual
differences.
K.L.1.2
Students know living and nonliving things are made of parts and people give names to the parts that are different from the name of the whole
object, plant or animal. Students know that the parts of living and nonliving things work best as a whole and some objects can easily be taken

apart and put back together again while other objects cannot be taken apart without damaging them (e.g., books, pencils, plants, and animals).
Students know some of the characteristics that all animals share that can be used to compare living and nonliving things. Students know that
all animals, including humans, have a basic structure that is similar in all animals of the same kind.
        Structure: Students know that the human body has distinct structures and that they serve different functions that is similar in other
        animals. Students know how to describe the structure of various animals, to include humans, and tell how the structures are alike and
        different and how each structure is used in a similar or different way.
        Growth and Changes: Students observe and compare how different organisms grow and develop over time. Students know that
        animals change as they grow. The distinct stages of growth and change are called a life cycle. The life cycle begins when the organism
        is born and begins to develop and ends when the organism dies.
        Movement: Students know how various animals move noting similarities and differences.
        Basic needs: Students know that all animals are living things that have basic needs to stay alive. Animals need air, water, food, and
        shelter for protection. If an organism does not get everything that it needs to stay alive, it will die. By comparing these characteristics
        of several animals, students begin to classify things as living and nonliving based on these characteristics.
     Students know that animals (including humans) are living things that grow and develop, and need food, air, and water but nonliving things
do not. At this grade level, it is appropriate to define living things as anything that is alive or has ever been alive and nonliving as anything that
is not now and has never been alive.

   Infer how momentum is a relationship between mass and velocity of an object, p mv . The focus should be on the conceptual
   understanding that the same momentum could be associated with a slow-moving massive object and an object moving at high velocity with
   a very small mass (e.g.- 100 kg object moving 1 m/s has the same momentum as a 1-kg object moving 100m/s)
   Explain change in momentum in terms of the magnitude of the applied force and the time interval that the force is applied to the object.

Unpacking
What does this standards mean a child will know and be able to do?
PSc.1.2.1
   Recognize that the weight of an object is a measure of the force of gravity and is the product of its mass and the acceleration due to gravity:
   Fg = mg
                                                                                                                                    m
   With negligible air resistance, explain acceleration due to gravity as an example of uniformly changing velocity: g 9.8 2

   Relate the presence of air resistance to the concept of terminal velocity of an object in free fall.
PSc.1.2.2
   Identify friction as a force that opposes motion of an object. (Review from middle school.)
   Classify the frictional forces present in a situation such as a book resting on a table (static), a box pushed across the floor (sliding), a ball
   rolling across the floor (rolling), a boat moving through a river (fluid), or an object in free-fall (fluid).
PSc.1.2.3
   Explain the property of inertia as related to mass - the motion of an object will remain the same (either at rest or moving at a constant speed
   in a straight line) in the absence of unbalanced forces; if a change in motion of an object is observed, there must have been a net force on
   the object.
   Explain balanced and unbalanced forces mathematically and graphically with respect to acceleration to establish the relationship between
                                                           1

   Explain qualitatively and quantitatively the relationship between force, mass and acceleration the greater the force on an object, the greater
   its change in motion; however, the same amount of force applied to an object with less mass results in a greater acceleration.

PSc.2.1.2
   Develop a conceptual cause-and-effect model for the phase change process that shows the relationship among particle attraction, particle
   motion, and gain or loss of heat - when a solid melts it has absorbed heat that increased the potential energy of its particles (space between
   particles) thus reducing the attraction between particles so that they can flow in a liquid phase. (Consider conditions of normal atmospheric
   pressure as well as the qualitative affects of changes in pressure involving gases.)
   The focus should be on the following phase changes: solid to liquid (melting), liquid to gas (vaporization), gas to liquid (condensation), and
   liquid to solid (freezing).
   Compare the process of evaporation to vaporization materials that evaporate verses those which do not; attraction between surface
   particles and colliding air molecules.
   Recognize that the formation of solutions is a physical change forming a homogenous mixture. (Review from 8th grade.)
   Develop a conceptual model for the solution process with a cause and effect relationship involving forces of attraction between solute and
   solvent particles. A material is insoluble due to a lack of attraction between particles.

* Note: While there is value in students understanding the historical development of atomic theory, the focus is on understanding the
relationship between structure and properties of matter. The Quantum Mechanical Model of the atom provides a more in-depth
understanding of atomic structure; it can be included as an enrichment topic, but goes beyond the level of the objective. Students taking
Chemistry would extend to this depth of understanding.
