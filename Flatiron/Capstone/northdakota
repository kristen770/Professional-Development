Foreword
These new North Dakota academic content standards for science give our educators, school administrators, and parents the information they need
about what our students should know, and be able to do, during each step of their education journey, from kindergarten through high school.
The North Dakota Constitution recognizes the importance of public education in nurturing prosperity, happiness, and a “high degree of intelligence,
patriotism, integrity and morality.” Statewide academic content standards, and an assessment system that measures student progress, help us to reach
these noble objectives. By using our new, challenging science standards to measure student achievement, we can monitor growth, address
deficiencies, and ensure comparability of educational opportunity statewide.
While these North Dakota science standards represent a statewide reference point for teaching science content in classrooms, local school districts are
encouraged to use the standards as a guide for developing their own local, customized science curriculum.
This publication is the result of months of conscientious work by 34 North Dakota science educators from our K-12 schools and university system. They
agreed to devote the many hours needed to write these new standards. They represented various areas of expertise, including general education,
special education, English learners, early childhood education, and higher education.
The work on these new standards began in January 2018 and continued throughout the year. The writing committee’s drafts were made available for
public comment, which generated useful opinions from teachers, administrators, parents, and the community.
A panel of business people, community leaders, and representatives of the general public provided another layer of review. These included
representatives of private sector business, including representatives of energy and agriculture, and people who have strong beliefs about what our
science standards should include. I am grateful to those who devoted their time and talents to go over these drafts and provide their recommendations
to the writing committee.
No one is better qualified to improve our North Dakota science standards than our North Dakota educators. This document is an exemplar of the best in
North Dakota education – North Dakota teachers, writing statewide standards in an open, transparent and painstaking manner.
Each member of the writing team deserves our thanks for their extensive research, analysis and deliberations. Thanks to their work, these standards
are ready to be used in our classrooms across the state.

Introduction
Purpose and Development:
The North Dakota Science Content Standards focus on providing hands-on practices as well as rigorous content knowledge. These
standards are a collaborative effort of K-12 educators, college instructors, and curriculum advisors from across the state of North
Dakota. The standards were developed using the most current research and trends in science education with a focus on embedding the
science and engineering practices to develop and support critical thinking skills.
The science standards have been aligned vertically across the disciplines and grade levels to provide all students with a solid
foundation. North Dakota’s issues and interests have been considered and emphasized throughout the document while using the Next
Generation Science Standards as well as other state science standards as a framework. These standards were developed in a manner
that provide local districts and their educators the autonomy to construct curriculum to meet the needs of their students.
Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs)
Disciplinary Core Ideas describe the most essential ideas (content) of the performance standards that students will understand.
The DCIs are grouped into four science domains.
         1. Physical Science (PS)
         2. Life Science (LS)
         3. Earth and Space Science (ESS)
         4. Engineering and Technology (ET)
Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs)
The SEPs were used to construct the performance standards to guide instruction using practices encapsulated by these eight
categories.
         1. Asking questions and defining problems
         2. Developing and using models
         3. Planning and carrying out investigations
         4. Analyzing and interpreting data
         5. Using mathematics and computational thinking
         6. Constructing explanations and designing solutions
         7. Engaging in argument from evidence
         8. Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information
                                                                     7


K-12 science instruction utilizing the Science and Engineering Practices will:
           1. Have broad importance across multiple sciences or engineering disciplines or be a key organizing principle of a single
              discipline.
           2. Provide a key tool for understanding or investigating more complex ideas and solving problems.
           3. Relate to the interests and life experiences of students or be connected to societal or personal concerns that require
              scientific or technological knowledge.
           4. Be scaffolded to support learning over multiple grades at increasing levels of depth and sophistication.
Crosscutting Concepts (CCs)
Crosscutting Concepts are fundamental science concepts which are embedded into each performance standard. These concepts
serve the purpose of linking all the domains of science and the knowledge contained within to foster an intelligible and scientific
understanding of the world around us. The CCs will be utilized at all grade levels in all domains.
The CCs include these universal scientific concepts:
           1. Patterns
           2. Cause and Effect
           3. Scale, Proportion and Quantity
           4. Systems and System Models
           5. Energy and Matter
           6. Structure and Function
           7. Stability and Change
North Dakota Connections
Opportunities to teach science directly relevant to our state are highlighted throughout the North Dakota State Science Standards as
North Dakota Connections. These connections provide educators with local, regional, and state specific contexts for teaching, learning,
and assessment. Educators may use these resources for investigations with students. This approach provides opportunities for
educators to draw upon North Dakota’s natural environment and rich history, while utilizing resources in engineering design and
scientific research to support student learning.
                                                                      7

                                                8


Engineering & Technology
The engineering and technology
standards are integrated into each grade
level and discipline. The engineering and
technology performance standards are
based upon the application of the
engineering design process (EDP). The
EDP provides students with a means of
doing science rather than just knowing it.
These practices help students form an
understanding of the crosscutting
concepts and disciplinary core ideas of
science. Practicing the EDP helps
students understand the link between
science and engineering, making their
knowledge more meaningful.
                                           9


The Process of Science
Science is a process for experimentation
that is used to explore observations and
answer questions. The goal is to discover
cause and effect relationships by making
observations, asking questions, carefully
gathering and examining the evidence, to
determine if all the available information
can be combined into a logical
conclusion.

                                      Science and Engineering Practices:
1. Asking questions and defining problems
    − Asking questions and defining problems in K-12 builds on prior experiences and progresses to simple descriptive
       questions.
2. Developing and using models
    − Modeling in K-12 builds on prior experiences and progresses to include using and developing models (i.e., diagrams,
       drawing, physical replica, diorama, dramatization, or storyboard) that represent concrete events or design solutions.
3. Planning and carrying out investigations
    − Planning and carrying out K-12 investigations to answer questions or test solutions to problems build on prior
       experiences and progresses to simple investigations, based on fair tests, which provide data to support explanations
       or design solutions.
4. Analyzing and interpreting data
    − Analyzing data in K-12 builds on prior experiences and progresses to collecting, recording, and sharing
       observations.
5. Using mathematics and computational thinking
    − Using mathematics and computational thinking in K-12 builds logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.
6. Constructing explanations and designing solutions
    − Constructing explanations and designing solutions in K-12 builds on prior experiences and progresses to the use of
       evidence and ideas in constructing evidence-based accounts of natural phenomena and designing solutions.
7. Engaging in argument from evidence
    − Engaging in argument from evidence in K-12 builds on prior experiences and progresses to comparing ideas and
       representations about the natural and designed world(s).

                                              locations, magnitudes, and frequencies of the natural hazards. Examples of technologies can be global (such as
                                              satellite systems to monitor hurricanes or forest fires) or local (such as building basements in tornado-prone

    seashells indicate shelled organisms that lived in aquatic environments).
    iii. By comparing data about where fossils are found and what those environments are like, fossilized plants and animals can be used to provide evidence that
    some environments look very different now than they did a long time ago (e.g., fossilized seashells found on land that is now dry suggest that the area in which
3 a those fossils were found used to be aquatic; tropical plant fossils found in Antarctica, where tropical plants cannot live today, suggests that the area used to be
    tropical).

  Evidence
     Students identify the evidence relevant to supporting the explanation, including local and regional patterns in the following:

  Reasoning
     Students use reasoning to connect the evidence to support particular points of the explanation, including the identification of a specific pattern of rock layers
     and fossils (e.g., a rock layer containing shells and fish below a rock layer containing fossils of land animals and plants is a pattern indicating that, at one
     point, the landscape had been covered by water and later it was dry land). Students describe* reasoning for how the evidence supports particular points of
     the explanation, including:
     i. Specific rock layers in the same location show specific fossil patterns (e.g., some lower rock layers have marine fossils, while some higher rock layers have
3 a fossils of land plants).
     ii. Since lower layers were formed first then covered by upper layers, this pattern indicates that the landscape of the area was transformed into the landscape
     indicated by the upper layer (e.g., lower marine fossils indicate that, at one point, the landscape was covered by water, and upper land fossils indicate that
     later the landscape was dry land).
     iii. Irregularities in the patterns of rock layers indicate disruptions due to Earth forces (e.g., a canyon with different rock layers in the walls and a river in the

    i. Information in the environment interacts with animal behavioral output via interactions mediated by the brain.
    ii. Different types of sensory information are relayed to the brain via different sensory receptors, allowing experiences to be perceived, stored as memories, and
  a influence behavior (e.g., an animal sees a brown, rotten fruit and smells a bad odor — this sensory information allows the animal to use information about other
    fruits that appear to be rotting to make decisions about what to eat; an animal sees a red fruit and a green fruit — after eating them both, the animal learns that
    the red fruit is sweet and the green fruit is bitter and then uses this sensory information, perceived and stored as memories, to guide fruit selection next time).

  Articulating the explanation of phenomena
    Students articulate a statement that relates the given phenomenon to a scientific idea, including that the speed of a given object is related to the energy of the
1 a object (e.g., the faster an object is moving, the more energy it possesses).
  b Students use the evidence and reasoning to construct an explanation for the phenomenon.
  Evidence
    Students identify and describe* the relevant given evidence for the explanation, including:
    i The relative speed of the object (e.g., faster vs. slower objects).
2a
    ii. Qualitative indicators of the amount of energy of the object, as determined by a transfer of energy from that object (e.g., more or less sound produced in a
    collision, more or less heat produced when objects rub together, relative speed of a ball that was stationary following a collision with a moving object, more or
    less distance a stationary object is moved).
  Reasoning
    Students use reasoning to connect the evidence to support an explanation for the phenomenon. In the explanation, students describe* a chain of reasoning
3 a that includes:
    i. Motion can indicate the energy of an object.
    ii. The faster a given object is moving, the more observable impact it can have on another object (e.g., a fast-moving ball striking something (a gong, a wall)
    makes more noise than does the same ball moving slowly and striking the same thing).
    iii. The observable impact of a moving object interacting with its surroundings reflects how much energy was able to be transferred between objects and
    therefore relates to the energy of the moving object.
    iv. Because faster objects have a larger impact on their surroundings than objects moving more slowly, they have more energy due to motion (e.g., a fast-
    moving ball striking a gong makes more noise than a slow-moving ball doing the same thing because it has more energy that can be transferred to the gong,
    producing more sound). [Note: This refers only to relative bulk motion energy, not potential energy].
    v. Therefore, the speed of an object is related to the energy of the object.
                                                                                   298

   4. Sound traveling from one place to another.
   5. Heat passing from one object to another.
1 6. Motion, sound, heat, and light causing a different type of energy to be observed after an interaction (e.g., in a collision between two objects, one object may
   slow down or stop, the other object may speed up, and the objects and surrounding air may be heated; a specific sound may cause the movement of an
   object; the energy associated with the motion of an object, via an electrical current, may be used to turn on a light).

   can be transferred from place to place by:

 Identifying the evidence to address the purpose of the investigation
   From the given investigation plan, students describe* the data to be collected that will serve as the basis for evidence, including:
   i. The motion and collision of objects before and after an interaction (e.g., when a given object is moving fast, it can move another object farther than when the
   same object is moving more slowly).
 a ii. The relative presence of sound, light, or heat (including in the surrounding air) before and after an interaction (e.g. shining a light on an object can increase
   the temperature of the object; a sound can move an object).
2 iii. The presence of electric currents flowing through wires causally linking one form of energy output (e.g., a moving object) to another form of energy output
   (e.g., another moving object; turning on a light bulb).
   Students describe* how their observations will address the purpose of the investigation, including how the observations will provide evidence that energy, in
   the form of light, sound, heat, and motion, can be transferred from place to place by sound, light, heat, or electric currents (e.g., in a system in which the
   motion of an object generates an observable electrical current to turn on a light, energy (from the motion of an object) must be transferred to another place
 b (energy in the form of the light bulb) via the electrical current, because the motion doesn’t cause the light bulb to light up if the wire is not completing a circuit
   between them; when a light is directed at an object, energy (in the form of light) must be transferred from the source of the light to its destination and can be
   observed in the form of heat, because if the light is blocked, the object isn’t warmed.
 Planning the investigation
   From the given investigation plan, students identify and describe* how the data will be observed and recorded, including the tools and methods for collecting
3 data on:
 a
   i. The motion and collision of objects, including any sound or heat producing the motion/collision, or produced by the motion/collision.

   ii. The presence of energy in the form of sound, light, or heat in one place as a result of sound, light, or heat in a different place.
   iii. The presence of electric currents in wires and the presence of energy (in the form of sound, light, heat, or motion resulting from the flow of electric currents
   through a device).
 b Students describe* the number of trials, controlled variables, and experimental set up.
 Collecting the data
   Students make and record observations according to the given investigation plan to provide evidence that:
4 i. Energy is present whenever there are moving objects, sound, light, or heat.
 a ii. That energy has been transferred from place to place (e.g., a bulb in a circuit is not lit until a switch is closed and it lights, indicating that energy is
   transferred through electric current in a wire to light the bulb; a stationary ball is struck by a moving ball, causing the stationary ball to move and the moving
   ball to slow down, indicating that energy has been transferred from the moving ball to the stationary one).
                                                                                    300

Observable features of the student performance by the end of the grade:
  Supported claims
1     Students identify a given claim to be supported about a given phenomenon. The claim includes the idea that plants acquire the materials they need for
  a
      growth chiefly from air and water.
  Identifying scientific evidence
      Students describe* the given evidence, data, and/or models that support the claim, including evidence of:
2
  a i. Plant growth over time.
      ii. Changes in the weight of soil and water within a closed system with a plant, indicating:
      1. Soil does not provide most of the material for plant growth (e.g., changes in weight of soil and a plant in a pot over time, hydroponic growth of plants).
      2. Plants’ inability to grow without water.
      iii. Plants’ inability to grow without air.
      iv. Air is matter (e.g., empty object vs. air filled object).
3 Evaluating and critiquing evidence
  a Students determine whether the evidence supports the claim, including:
    i. Whether a particular material (e.g. air, soil) is required for growth of plants.
    ii. Whether a particular material (e.g. air, soil) may provide sufficient matter to account for an observed increase in weight of a plant during growth.
  Reasoning and synthesis
4
  a Students use reasoning to connect the evidence to support the claim with argumentation. Students describe* a chain of reasoning that includes:
      i. During plant growth in soil, the weight of the soil changes very little over time, whereas the weight of the plant changes a lot. Additionally, some plants can
  a
      be grown without soil at all.
      ii. Because some plants don’t need soil to grow, and others show increases in plant matter (as measured by weight) but not accompanying decreases in soil
  a
      matter, the material from soil must not enter the plant in sufficient quantities to be the chief contributor to plant growth.
      iii. Therefore, plants do not acquire most of the material for growth from soil.
      iv. A plant cannot grow without water or air. Because both air and water are matter and are transported into the plant system, they can provide the materials
  a plants need for growth.
      v. Since soil cannot account for the change in weight as a plant grows and since plants take in water and air, both of which could contribute to the increase in
      weight during plant growth, plant growth must come chiefly from water and air.
                                                                                      310

    organism’s food within the ecosystem).
    iv. That changing an aspect (e.g., organisms or environment) of the ecosystem will affect other aspects of the ecosystem.
                                                                                   311
