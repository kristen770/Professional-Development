    Part I DIRECTIONS There are 45 questions on Part I of the test. Each question is followed by three or four choices, numbered 1 through 4. Read each question carefully. Decide which choice is the 

best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each 
question by Þlling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen. Read the sample question below. 
Sample Question Earth gets most of its light from (1) the stars 
(2) the Sun 

(3) the Moon 

(4) other planets 
The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look at the box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2 is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2 has been Þ lled in. Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each 
question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your Þrst mark completely. 

Then mark the answer you want. You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your 
answers to the questions. You may use a calculator if needed.

43An experiment is described below.
A large field at the base of a mountain
becomes flooded when heavy rains in the 

mountains cause a stream to overflow. Each time

the flooding occurs, more soil washes away.
The owners of the land want to perform an
experiment to see if different types of plants

could help reduce the soil erosion. They choose

five areas of ground that are the same size, the

same distance from the stream, have the same

slope and the same kind of soil, and receive the

same amount of sunlight. The type of plant

planted in each area is different for each of the

five areas. Measurements of soil erosion will be

made each time flooding occurs. The results will
be compared after six months.
Which hypothesis is being tested in this 
experiment?(1)Soil erosion is affected by the strength of the
wind.(2)Flooded areas have greater soil erosion than 
areas that are not flooded.(3)Some types of plants reduce soil erosion
more than others.
(4)Some types of soil are more easily eroded.

science.A group of students conducted an experiment to test the hypothesis that radish plants
watered with acidic rainwater would not be as tall as radish plants watered with 
nonacidicrainwater. The students planted two identical radish seeds in equal amounts of soil. One was

watered with nonacidicrainwater, and the other was watered with an equal amount of acidic
rainwater. All other variables that would affect plant growth were the same for both plants.

The students measured the heights of the plants in centimeters (cm). The height of the plant

watered with acidic rainwater on various days is shown in the table below.

Earth™s Shrinking Glaciers
Scientists measure the thickness of glaciers to determine the effect that warmer 
temperatures have on Earth. During the last few decades, glaciers around the world have

decreased in size. The data table lists the average cumulative loss in the thickness of glaciers

in nine regions of Earth for the years shown. Cumulative means that the amount of loss for

each year is added to all the previous years. Glacial thickness is measured in meters (m).

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Gems and MineralsThere are about 4,000 types of minerals on Earth. Of these, only about 15 areused to make gems. Gems are minerals that may have been cut and polished to
make them sparkle.  The diamond is the hardest natural substance we know. Diamonds form deep
under ground at very high temperatures and pressure conditions caused by the
overlying thick layers of rock that squeeze the carbon atoms into a tight, strong 
crystal.Diamonds might grow under these conditions for 1 billion to 3 billion years andtherefore are considered the oldest gemstone. Only about 20 percent of diamonds
are made into jewels. Because they are so hard, most diamonds are used to make
tools such as dental drills and metal cutters.

Gender in humans is determined by a pair of sex chromosomes. A female has  two X chromosomes and a male has one X and one Y chromosome. A recessive gene
that causes color blindness is located on the X chromosome. When a male inherits
this gene, he will be color-blind because the Y chromosome does not contain a gene

for color blindness.In order for a female to be color-blind, she must inherit the recessive gene on
both X chromosomes. If she has the gene on only one chromosome, she is notcolor-
blind. She is called a carrier because she can pass this gene along to her 
offspring. The pedigree chart shows the children and grandchildren of a female 
carrier and a male who is notcolor-blind.

[14]Base your answers to questions 50 and 51 on the information about blood groups below.
Human blood is classified into four blood types: A, B, AB, and O. An offspringÕs blood
type is determined by genes passed on from the offspringÕs parents. Each parent gives an off-

spring one gene for blood type. The combination of the two genes determines the offspringÕs

blood type.
There are three genes, 
A, B, and o, that are responsible for the four blood types. The
table below shows how these three genes interact to produce the four blood types.
50The Punnett square below shows the probability of blood types in the offspring of two parents. One 
parentÕs blood type genes are

5/5/2005We are doing an experiment to determine if the size of soil particles affects the amount
of water that ßows through soil. We poured 100 milliliters (mL) of water through four dif-

ferent types of soil. The equipment is shown below.
We got the following results: With gray soil, the average particle size was 2.0 millimeters (mm)
and 80 mL of water ßowed through. We then used tan soil. Its average particle size was 0.5 mm

and 40 mL of water ßowed through. With brown soil, 60 mL of water ßowed through. Brown

soil has an average particle size of 1.5 mm. In our last trial we used black soil. It has an 
average particle size of 1.0 mm and 50 mL of water ßowed through.aUsing the data table below, organize the results to show the average particle size and the amount of

Part IIDirections(46Ð80): Record your answers in the spaces provided in this test booklet.Base your answers to questions 46 through 48 on the information and table below and on your knowledgeof science.A farmer grows and sells flowering plants. The best-selling plants are the ones withthe most blossoms. The farmer reads an advertisement for a plant food saying that it willmake plants grow faster and taller. The farmer predicts that taller plants will have more

blossoms and performs the following experiment to test this hypothesis.Two groups of 10 plants each are grown in identical pots filled with equal amounts ofidentical soil. The amount of sunlight, the room temperature, and the amount of water are
held constant for both groups. Group Ais given plant food at regular intervals accordingto the instructions on the package. Group Bis not given plant food.The farmer observes the plants after 15 weeks of growth. The results are recorded below.

Base your answers to questions 59 through 61 on the passage below and on your knowledge of science.Acid RainSulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are pollutants released into the atmosphere fromthe burning of fossil fuels. These pollutants combine with moisture in the air to form acidrain. A main source of these pollutants can be traced to power plants located in the mid-
western United States. Due to weather patterns, the effects of acid rain have been most
severe in the northeastern United States, including New York State.
The acid rain destroys the natural balance in lakes and streams and kills many speciesof fish. Acidic conditions affect not only lakes and forests, but also buildings and statues
composed of limestone and marble. Other materials, such as metals, ceramics, glass,
paints, and leather, are affected by acid rain.

43An experiment is described below.
A large field at the base of a mountain
becomes flooded when heavy rains in the 

mountains cause a stream to overflow. Each time

the flooding occurs, more soil washes away.
The owners of the land want to perform an
experiment to see if different types of plants

could help reduce the soil erosion. They choose

five areas of ground that are the same size, the

same distance from the stream, have the same

slope and the same kind of soil, and receive the

same amount of sunlight. The type of plant

planted in each area is different for each of the

five areas. Measurements of soil erosion will be

made each time flooding occurs. The results will
be compared after six months.
Which hypothesis is being tested in this 
experiment?(1)Soil erosion is affected by the strength of the
wind.(2)Flooded areas have greater soil erosion than 
areas that are not flooded.(3)Some types of plants reduce soil erosion
more than others.
(4)Some types of soil are more easily eroded.

Earth™s Shrinking Glaciers
Scientists measure the thickness of glaciers to determine the effect that warmer 
temperatures have on Earth. During the last few decades, glaciers around the world have

decreased in size. The data table lists the average cumulative loss in the thickness of glaciers

in nine regions of Earth for the years shown. Cumulative means that the amount of loss for

each year is added to all the previous years. Glacial thickness is measured in meters (m).

best answer. On the separate answer sheet, mark your answer in the row of circles for each

question by ﬁlling in the circle that has the same number as the answer you have chosen.Read the sample question below.
Sample QuestionEarth gets most of its light from(1) the stars
(2) the Sun

(3) the Moon

(4) other planets
The correct answer is the Sun, which is choice number 2. On your answer sheet, look atthe box showing the row of answer circles for the sample question. Since choice number 2is the correct answer for the sample question, the circle with the number 2has been ﬁlledin.Answer all of the questions in Part I in the same way. Mark only one answer for each 
question. If you want to change an answer, be sure to erase your ﬁrst mark completely.

Then mark the answer you want.You will not need scrap paper. You may use the pages of this test booklet to work out your
answers to the questions.You may use a calculator if needed.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Gems and MineralsThere are about 4,000 types of minerals on Earth. Of these, only about 15 areused to make gems. Gems are minerals that may have been cut and polished to
make them sparkle.  The diamond is the hardest natural substance we know. Diamonds form deep
under ground at very high temperatures and pressure conditions caused by the
overlying thick layers of rock that squeeze the carbon atoms into a tight, strong 
crystal.Diamonds might grow under these conditions for 1 billion to 3 billion years andtherefore are considered the oldest gemstone. Only about 20 percent of diamonds
are made into jewels. Because they are so hard, most diamonds are used to make
tools such as dental drills and metal cutters.

Gender in humans is determined by a pair of sex chromosomes. A female has  two X chromosomes and a male has one X and one Y chromosome. A recessive gene
that causes color blindness is located on the X chromosome. When a male inherits
this gene, he will be color-blind because the Y chromosome does not contain a gene

for color blindness.In order for a female to be color-blind, she must inherit the recessive gene on
both X chromosomes. If she has the gene on only one chromosome, she is notcolor-
blind. She is called a carrier because she can pass this gene along to her 
offspring. The pedigree chart shows the children and grandchildren of a female 
carrier and a male who is notcolor-blind.

[14]Base your answers to questions 50 and 51 on the information about blood groups below.
Human blood is classified into four blood types: A, B, AB, and O. An offspringÕs blood
type is determined by genes passed on from the offspringÕs parents. Each parent gives an off-

spring one gene for blood type. The combination of the two genes determines the offspringÕs

blood type.
There are three genes, 
A, B, and o, that are responsible for the four blood types. The
table below shows how these three genes interact to produce the four blood types.
50The Punnett square below shows the probability of blood types in the offspring of two parents. One 
parentÕs blood type genes are 
ABand the other parentÕs blood type genes are
