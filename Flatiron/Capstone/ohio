By using the 5E Learning Cycles teachers will be able to:
    •   Provide supports to students as they learn to frame questions, assess and analyze data, and create and critique explanations (including engaging with
        others in a public forum) – all important components of scientific and engineering practices.
    •   Select instructional materials that promote the teaching and learning of science by using scientific and engineering practices.
    •   Assess students’ abilities in multiple ways that are compatible with scientific and engineering practices.
Students engaging with grade-appropriate science content through scientific and engineering practices and the 5E Learning Cycle will be better prepared to meet
the challenges as they enter higher education or pursue careers.

Description of a Scientific Model
A scientific model is a mental construct that represents a large-scale system or process. The model may be abstract, conceptual, mathematical, graphical and/or
computer based. Scientific models are valuable for promoting understanding of interactions within and between systems and explaining and predicting observed
phenomena as simply as possible. It is important to note that scientific models are incomplete representations of the actual systems and phenomena. They can
change over time as new evidence is discovered that cannot be explained using the old model. Since the goal of a model is to promote understanding, simpler,
less complete models still can be used when more advanced and complex models do little to contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon considered. For
example, the quantum model of the atom would not necessarily be the best model to use to understand the behavior of gases.

  One goal of science education is to help students become scientifically literate citizens able to use science as a way of knowing about the natural and
  material world. All students should have sufficient understanding of scientific knowledge and scientific processes to enable them to distinguish what is
  science from what is not science and to make informed decisions about career choices, health maintenance, quality of life, community and other decisions

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research

engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.

OHIO’S LEARNING STANDARDS | SCIENCE | ADOPTED 2018                                                                                                              29
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

NATURE OF SCIENCE GRADES K-2
  Nature of Science
  One goal of science education is to help students become scientifically literate citizens able to use science as a way of knowing about the natural and
  material world. All students should have sufficient understanding of scientific knowledge and scientific processes to enable them to distinguish what is
  science from what is not science and to make informed decisions about career choices, health maintenance, quality of life, community and other decisions
  that impact both themselves and others.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students with
opportunities to engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of
Science.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

NATURE OF SCIENCE GRADES K-2
  Nature of Science
  One goal of science education is to help students become scientifically literate citizens able to use science as a way of knowing about the natural and
  material world. All students should have sufficient understanding of scientific knowledge and scientific processes to enable them to distinguish what is
  science from what is not science and to make informed decisions about career choices, health maintenance, quality of life, community and other decisions
  that impact both themselves and others.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is

 The change in motion of an object is related to the

 Some forces act without touching, such as using a        pushing or pulling). Other forces act when objects are not in contact with each other (e.g., magnetic,

                                                          instruction.
                                                          Earth’s gravity pulls any object toward it, without touching the object. Static electricity also can pull or
                                                          push objects without touching the object. Magnets can pull some objects to them (attraction) or push
                                                          objects away from them (repulsion). Gravity, static electricity and magnets can be explored through
                                                          experimentation, testing and investigation at this grade level.
                                                          For a particular object, larger forces cause larger changes in motion. A strong kick to a rock is able to
                                                          cause more change in motion than a weak kick to the same rock. Real-world experiences and
                                                          investigations are used for this concept. There often is confusion between the concepts of force and
                                                          energy. Force can be thought of as a push or pull between two objects and energy as the property of
                                                          an object that can cause change. A force acting on an object can sometimes result in a change in
                                                          energy. The difference between force and energy will be developed over time and is not appropriate at

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

INTRODUCTION TO CONTENT STATEMENTS
GRADE BAND THEME: INTERCONNECTIONS WITHIN SYSTEMS
This theme focuses on helping students explore the components of various systems and then investigate dynamic and sustainable relationships within systems
using scientific inquiry.
STRANDS
Strand Connections: Matter is what makes up all living and nonliving substances on Earth. Matter has specific properties and exists in different states. Earth’s
resources are made of matter. Matter can be used by living things for materials and energy. There are many different forms of energy. Each living component of an
ecosystem is composed of matter and uses energy.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

 3.PS.3: Heat, electrical energy, light, sound and         Prior Concepts Related to Sound, Energy and Motion
 magnetic energy are forms of energy.                      PreK-2: Vibrations are associated with sound. An object is in motion when its position is changing.
                                                           Forces change the motion of an object. Sunlight is the principal source of energy on Earth and warms
 There are many different forms of energy. Energy is

 is able to observe.                                       Examples of energy causing motion or creating change include a falling rock causing a crater to form

                                                           causing movement in uncharged objects or other electrically charged objects, sound from a drum
                                                           causing rice sitting on the drum to vibrate and magnets causing other magnets and some metal objects
                                                           to move.
                                                           Investigations (3-D or virtual) are used to demonstrate the relationship between different forms of
                                                           energy and motion. It is not appropriate at this grade level to explore the different types of energy in
                                                           depth or use wave terminology when discussing energy. These will be developed at later grades. There
                                                           often is confusion between the concepts of force and energy. Force can be thought of as a push or pull
                                                           between two objects and energy as the property of an object that can cause change. If forces actually
                                                           push or pull something over a distance, then there is an exchange of energy between the objects. The
                                                           differences between force and energy will be developed over time and are not appropriate for this
                                                           grade level. The word “heat” is used loosely in everyday language, yet it has a very specific scientific
                                                           meaning. Usually what is called heat is actually thermal or radiant energy. An object has thermal
                                                           energy due to the random movement of the particles that make up the object. Radiant energy is that
                                                           which is given off by objects through space (e.g., warmth from a fire, solar energy from the sun).
                                                           “Heating” is used to describe the transfer of thermal or radiant energy to another object or place.
                                                           Differentiating between these concepts is not appropriate at this grade. This document uses the same
                                                           conventions as noted in the NAEP 2009 Science Framework (see page 29) where “heat” is used in
                                                           lower grades. However, the word “heat” has been used with care so it refers to a transfer of thermal or

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

  Nature of Science
  One goal of science education is to help students become scientifically literate citizens able to use science as a way of knowing about the natural and material
  world. All students should have sufficient understanding of scientific knowledge and scientific processes to enable them to distinguish what is science from what
  is not science and to make informed decisions about career choices, health maintenance, quality of life, community and other decisions that impact both
  themselves and others.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

                                                          There are materials in which the entire object becomes hot when one part of the object is heated (e.g.,
                                                          in a metal pan heat flows through the pan on the stove transferring the heat from the burner outside the

                                                          another part of the object is heated (e.g., in a Styrofoam® cup, very little of the warmth from hot liquid

                                                          The word “heat” is used loosely in everyday language, yet it has a very specific scientific meaning.
                                                          Usually what is called heat is actually thermal or radiant energy. An object has thermal energy due to
                                                          the random movement of the particles that make up the object. Radiant energy is that which is given off
                                                          by objects through space (e.g., warmth from a fire, solar energy from the sun). “Heating” is used to
                                                          describe the transfer of thermal or radiant energy to another object or place. Differentiating between
                                                          heat, thermal energy and radiant energy is not appropriate at this grade. This document uses the same
                                                          conventions as noted in the NAEP 2009 Science Framework (see page 29) where “heat” is used in
                                                          lower grades. However, the word “heat” has been used with care so it refers to a transfer of thermal or

                                                          Electrical conductors are materials through which electricity can flow easily. Electricity introduced to

                                                          because electricity flows through the wires in a lamp from the outlet to the light bulb and back to the

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

This theme focuses on helping students explore the components of various systems and then investigate dynamic and sustainable relationships within systems
using scientific inquiry.
STRANDS
Strand Connections: Cycles on Earth, such as those occurring in ecosystems, in the solar system, and in the movement of light and sound result in describable
patterns. Speed is a measurement of movement. Change in speed is related to force and mass. The transfer of energy drives changes in systems, including
ecosystems and physical systems.

  Nature of Science
  One goal of science education is to help students become scientifically literate citizens able to use science as a way of knowing about the natural and material
  world. All students should have sufficient understanding of scientific knowledge and scientific processes to enable them to distinguish what is science from what
  is not science and to make informed decisions about career choices, health maintenance, quality of life, community and other decisions that impact both
  themselves and others.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

This topic focuses on the forces that affect motion. This includes the relationship between the change in speed of an object, the amount of force applied and the
mass of the object. Light and sound are explored as forms of energy that move in predictable ways, depending on the matter through which they move.

                                                             distance it travels increases with each successive unit of time. Speed should be investigated through
                                                             testing and experimentation. When possible, real-world settings are recommended for the

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

PHYSICAL SCIENCE (PS)
Topic: Light, Sound and Motion
This topic focuses on the forces that affect motion. This includes the relationship between the change in speed of an object, the amount of force applied and the
mass of the object. Light and sound are explored as forms of energy that move in predictable ways, depending on the matter through which they move.

                                                            When light passes from one material to another, it is often refracted at the boundary between the two

                                                            lens bends light and focuses it toward a single point. A prism bends white light and separates the
                                                            different colors of light. Prisms and magnifying lenses can be used to observe the refraction of light.
                                                            Visible light can be emitted from an object (like the sun) or reflected by an object (like a mirror or the

                                                            apple looks red because the red light that hits the apple is reflected while the other colors are
                                                            absorbed. The additive rules for color mixing of light, other than the fact that white light is a mixture of
                                                            many colors, are reserved for later grades. The wave nature of sound and light are not introduced at

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

                                                          Plants and some microorganisms are producers. They are the foundation of the food web. Producers

                                                          One way that ecosystem populations interact is centered on relationships for obtaining energy. Food
                                                          webs are defined in many ways, including as a scheme of feeding relationships, which resembles a
                                                          web. This web serves as a model for feeding relationships of member species within a biological
                                                          community. Members of a species may occupy different positions during their lives. Food chains and
                                                          webs are schematic representations of real-world interactions. For this grade level, it is enough to
                                                          recognize that food webs represent an intertwining of food chains within the same biological
                                                          community.
                                                          Organisms have symbiotic relationships in which individuals of one species are dependent upon
                                                          individuals of another species for survival. Symbiotic relationships can be categorized as mutualism
                                                          (where both species benefit), commensalism (where one species benefits and the other is unaffected),
                                                          and parasitism (where one species benefits and the other is harmed).
                                                          Investigations of locally threatened or endangered species can be conducted and include

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.

VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

NATURE OF SCIENCE GRADE 6-8
  Nature of Science
  One goal of science education is to help students become scientifically literate citizens able to use science as a way of knowing about the natural and material
  world. All students should have sufficient understanding of scientific knowledge and scientific processes to enable them to distinguish what is science from what
  is not science and to make informed decisions about career choices, health maintenance, quality of life, community and other decisions that impact both
  themselves and others.

OHIO’S LEARNING STANDARDS | SCIENCE | ADOPTED 2018                                                                                                               128
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.

                                                          space that matter occupies. Mass can be measured with a balance. The volume of solids can be

                                                          Equal volumes of different substances usually have different masses. Some materials, like lead or gold,
                                                          have a lot of mass in a relatively small space. Other materials, like packing peanuts and air, have a

                                                          material can change depending upon how much of the material there is, the density generally remains
                                                          constant, no matter how much of the material is present. Therefore, density can be used to identify a
                                                          material. Mass vs. volume graphs can be constructed and interpreted to determine which material has

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.

                                                           Modern Cell Theory states that cells come from pre-existing cells. Individual organisms do not live
                                                           forever. Therefore, reproduction is necessary for the continuation of every species. Traits are passed
                                                           on to the next generation through reproduction. Single-celled organisms reproduce by processes such
                                                           as mitosis, budding and binary fission.

                                                           purpose of growth and repair. All cells contain genetic materials. At this grade level, the genetic
                                                           material is described as chromosomes. Chromosomes are described as structures in cells that contain
                                                           genetic material. The chemicals and chemical processes associated with chromosomes are reserved
                                                           for high school biology. Microscopes, micrographs, models and illustrations can be used to observe
                                                           cells from different organisms in the process of dividing. It is not appropriate to learn the names of the

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.

                                                           hydrogen; water is a molecule containing two atoms of hydrogen joined with one atom of oxygen).
                                                           All particles of a pure substance have nearly identical mass. Particles of different substances usually
                                                           have different masses, depending on their composition. Each element and compound has properties,
                                                           some of which are independent of the amount of the sample.
                                                           For any change in a closed system, the number and type of atoms stay the same, even if the atoms are
                                                           rearranged. Therefore, the mass remains constant. Mass is always conserved in a closed system; this

                                                           less than the sum of the volumes. Heating liquid results in an increase in volume. The conservation of
                                                           matter can be demonstrated using simple balanced equations with their chemical formulas or pictorial

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

                                                           Mechanical energy is transferred when a force acts between objects to move one of the objects some

                                                           objects no longer exert forces on each other. Energy transfers should be experiential and observable at

                                                           Waves can be described by their speed, wavelength, amplitude and frequency. Vibrations cause wave-
                                                           like disturbances that transfer energy from one place to another. Mechanical waves require a material
                                                           (medium) in which to travel. The medium moves temporarily as the energy passes through it but
                                                           returns to its original undisturbed position. Mechanical waves are classified as transverse or
                                                           longitudinal (compressional) depending on the direction of movement of the medium. The energy of a
                                                           mechanical wave depends on the material and increases with amplitude. While light and other
                                                           electromagnetic waves do not require a medium and can travel through a vacuum, they can travel
                                                           through some media, such as clear glass. A wave travels at a constant speed through a particular
                                                           material as long as it is uniform (e.g., for water waves, having the same depth). The speed of the wave
                                                           depends on the nature of the material (e.g., sound waves travel faster through most solids than gases).
                                                           For a particular uniform medium, as the frequency (f) of the wave is increased, the wavelength (λ) of
                                                           the wave is decreased.
                                                           Gravitational potential energy is associated with the mass of an object and its height above a reference
                                                           point (e.g., above ground level, above floor level). A change in the height of an object is evidence that
                                                           the gravitational potential energy has changed.

OHIO’S LEARNING STANDARDS | SCIENCE | ADOPTED 2018                                                                                             174
                                        Elastic potential energy is associated with how much an elastic object has been stretched or
                                        compressed and how difficult such a compression or stretch is. A change in the amount of compression
                                        or stretch of an elastic object is evidence that the elastic potential energy has changed.
                                        Chemical potential energy is associated with the position and arrangement of the atoms within
                                        substances. Rearranging atoms into new positions to form new substances (chemical reaction) is
                                        evidence that the chemical potential energy has most likely changed. The energy transferred when a
                                        chemical system undergoes a reaction is often thermal energy.
                                        Electrical potential energy is associated with the position of electrically charged objects relative to each
                                        other and the amount of charge they have. A change in the position of charged particles relative to
                                        each other is evidence of a change in electrical potential energy.
                                        Generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and are used to produce electrical energy
                                        in power plants. Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical energy.
                                        For grade 7, investigation and experiments (3-D and virtual) are used to connect energy transfer and
                                        waves to the natural world. Real wave data (e.g., oceanic, seismic, light, sound) can be used.
                                        Heat is the transfer of energy from a warmer object to a cooler one. Thermal energy can be transferred
                                        when moving atoms collide. This energy transfer is conduction. Thermal energy can also be transferred
                                        by means of thermal currents in air, water or other fluids. As fluids are heated, they expand, decreasing
                                        the density. Cooler material with a greater density sinks while warmer material with less density rises,
                                        causing currents that transfer energy. This energy transfer is convection. Thermal energy can also be
                                        transformed into waves that radiate outward. This radiation can be absorbed by an object and
                                        transformed back into thermal energy. This energy transfer is radiation. Technology (e.g., virtual
                                        simulations, satellite imagery, remote sensing, accessing real-time temperature data) can be used to
                                        demonstrate the transfer of thermal energy on the surface or interior of Earth and within the solar
                                        system.
                                        An electric circuit exists when an energy source (e.g., battery, generator, solar cell) is connected to an
                                        electrical device (e.g., light bulb, motor) in a closed circuit. The energy source transfers energy to
                                        charges in the circuit. Charges flow through the circuit. Electric potential is a measure of the potential
                                        electrical energy of each charge. Differences in voltages can be measured with a voltmeter. The
                                        energy source does not create the charges; they were already present in the circuit. When the charges
                                        reach an electrical device, energy can be transformed into other forms of energy (e.g., light, sound,
                                        thermal, mechanical). The voltage drops after this energy transfer, but the charges continue to move
                                        through the circuit. In an open circuit, the charges stop flowing and energy is not transferred. Current is
                                        the rate of charge flow through conductors and can be measured with an ammeter. The degree to
                                        which current is opposed in a circuit is called resistance. Generally, for a particular energy source, the
                                        greater the resistance, the lower the current. The resistance through a wire depends upon the type of
                                        metal, the length of the wire and the diameter of the wire. Electrical devices can be connected in a
                                        series or as a parallel circuit. As the number of devices in a series loop increases, the current in the
                                        loop decreases. As loops are added in parallel, the current though the devices in each loop is the same
                                        as it would be if that loop were the only loop in the circuit. Many of the circuits used in modern devices
                                                                                                                          Back to Table of Contents

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

INTRODUCTION TO CONTENT STATEMENTS
GRADE BAND THEME: ORDER AND ORGANIZATION
This theme focuses on helping students use scientific inquiry to discover patterns, trends, structures and relationships that may be inferred from simple principles.
These principles are related to the properties or interactions within and between systems.
STRANDS
Strand Connections: Systems can be described and understood by analysis of the interaction of their components. Energy, forces and motion combine to change
the physical features of Earth. The changes of the physical Earth and the species that have lived on Earth are found in the rock record. For species to continue,
reproduction must be successful.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

OHIO’S LEARNING STANDARDS | SCIENCE | ADOPTED 2018                                                                                                               187
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

                                                          This content statement involves a basic introduction to the field model. A field model can be used to
                                                          explain how two objects can exert forces on each other without touching. Details about the field model
                                                          are not required other than the idea that a field is a concept that is used to understand forces that act at
                                                          a distance. An object is thought to have a region of influence, called a field, surrounding it. When a
                                                          second object with an appropriate property is placed in this region, the field exerts a force on and can
                                                          cause changes in the motion of the object. In grade 8, content will focus on connecting and organizing
                                                          prior knowledge using the field model. Three types of fields should be investigated: gravitational,
                                                          electric and magnetic.
                                                          Every object with mass exerts a gravitational force on every other object with mass. These forces are
                                                          hard to detect unless at least one of the objects is very massive (e.g., sun, planets). The gravitational
                                                          force increases with the mass of the objects, decreases rapidly with increasing distance and points
                                                          toward the center of objects. Weight is the force that a mass experiences in a gravitational field. Weight
                                                          is often confused with mass. Weight is proportional to mass, but depends upon the gravitational field at
                                                          a particular location. An object will have the same mass when it is on the moon as it does on Earth.
                                                          However, the weight (force of gravity) will be different at these two locations.
                                                          Electrostatic fields exist around objects with a net charge. If a second object with a net charge is placed
                                                          in the field, the two objects experience electric forces that can attract or repel them, depending on the
                                                          sign of the charges involved.
                                                          Magnetic fields exist around magnetic objects. If a second magnetic object is placed in the field, the
                                                          two objects experience magnetic forces that can attract or repel them, depending on the orientation of
                                                          the objects involved. Magnetic field lines can be seen when iron filings are sprinkled around a magnet.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

                                                          When multiple forces act on an object, their combined effort is what influences the object’s motion
                                                          (speed and direction). Forces can cancel to a net force of zero if they are equal in strength and act in
                                                          opposite directions. Such forces are said to be balanced. If all forces are balanced, the object will

                                                          remain stationary. If the object is moving, it will continue moving in the same direction and at the same
                                                          speed. When the net force is nonzero, the forces are unbalanced and the object’s motion will change.
                                                          The forces acting on an object can be modeled by a force diagram. Forces are represented by arrows
                                                          drawn on an isolated picture of the object. The direction of each arrow shows the direction of the force.
                                                          The length of each arrow represents the magnitude of the force. The effect of the net force on the
                                                          motion of an object can be predicted from a force diagram. The direction and relative size of the net
                                                          force can be identified from force diagrams involving multiple forces. Diagrams with forces in both the

                                                             Friction is a force that opposes sliding between two surfaces. For surfaces that are sliding relative to
                                                             each other, the force on an object always points in the direction opposite the relative motion of the
                                                             object. This force is known as kinetic friction. Drag is a force that opposes the motion of an object when
                                                             a solid object moves through a fluid (e.g., gas, liquid). Kinetic friction and drag affect the motion of
                                                             objects and may even cause moving objects to slow to a stop unless another force is exerted in the
                                                             direction of motion. A lack of understanding of friction can lead to the misconception that objects
                                                             require a sustained force to continue moving. Experimentation with objects that have limited friction
                                                             (e.g., a puck on an air hockey table, dry ice on a surface) can address this misconception. In grade 8,

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

NATURE OF SCIENCE HIGH SCHOOL
  Nature of Science
  One goal of science education is to help students become scientifically literate citizens able to use science as a way of knowing about the natural and material
  world. All students should have sufficient understanding of scientific knowledge and scientific processes to enable them to distinguish what is science from what
  is not science and to make informed decisions about career choices, health maintenance, quality of life, community and other decisions that impact both
  themselves and others.

CONTENT ELABORATION: STUDY OF MATTER
PS.M.1: Classification of matter
Matter was introduced in the elementary grades and the learning progression continued through middle school to include differences in the physical properties of
solids, liquids and gases. Elements, compounds, mixtures, molecules, kinetic and potential energy and the particulate nature of matter were introduced. Content in
Chemistry (e.g., electron configuration, molecular shapes, bond angles) will build on concepts in this course.
Matter can be classified in broad categories, such as homogeneous and heterogeneous, according to its composition or by its chemical properties (e.g., reactivity,
flammability, pH) and physical properties (e.g., color, solubility, odor, hardness, density, conductivity, melting point and boiling point, viscosity, malleability).
Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of a solute dissolved in a solvent. The amount of a solid solute that can dissolve in a solvent generally increases as the
temperature increases since the particles have more kinetic energy to overcome the attractive forces between them. Water is often used as a solvent since so
many substances will dissolve in water. Aqueous solutions can be classified as acidic (below 7 on the pH scale), neutral (7 on the pH scale), or basic (above 7 on
the pH scale), but the discussion of hydroxide and hydrogen ions as they relate to the pH scale is reserved for Chemistry. Physical properties can be used to
separate the substances in mixtures, including solutions.
Phase changes can be represented by graphing the temperature of a sample vs. the time it has been heated. Investigations include collecting data during heating,
cooling and solid-liquid-gas phase changes. At times, the temperature will change steadily, indicating a change in the motion of the particles and the kinetic energy
of the substance. However, during a phase change, the temperature of a substance does not change, indicating there is no change in kinetic energy. Since the
substance continues to gain or lose energy during phase changes, these changes in energy are potential and indicate a change in the position of the particles.
When heating a substance, a phase change will occur when the kinetic energy of the particles is great enough to overcome the attractive forces between the
particles; the substance then melts or boils. Conversely, when cooling a substance, a phase change will occur when the kinetic energy of the particles is no longer
great enough to overcome the attractive forces between the particles; the substance then condenses or freezes. Phase changes are examples of changes that can
occur when energy is absorbed from the surroundings (endothermic) or released into the surroundings (exothermic). When thermal energy is added to a solid,
liquid or gas, most substances increase in volume because the increased kinetic energy of the particles causes an increased distance between the particles. This
results in a change in density of the material. Generally, solids have greater density than liquids, which have greater density than gases due to the spacing
                                                                                                                                               Back to Table of Contents


OHIO’S LEARNING STANDARDS | SCIENCE | ADOPTED 2018                                                                                                               210
between the particles. The density of a substance can be calculated from the slope of a mass vs. volume graph. Differences in densities can be determined by
interpreting mass vs. volume graphs of the substances. Students should be able to calculate mass, volume or density, given two of the three values.
PS.M.2: Atoms
Content introduced in middle school, where the atom was introduced as a small, indestructible sphere, is further developed in this course. Over time, technology
was introduced that allowed the atom to be studied in more detail. The atom is composed of protons, neutrons and electrons that have measurable properties,
including mass and, in the case of protons and electrons, a characteristic charge. An atom is empty space with a very small positively charged nucleus. The
nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. The electrons move about in the empty space that surrounds the nucleus. Although current understanding goes
beyond the Bohr Model, it can still be used to represent the atom and develop the idea of valence electrons. Experimental evidence that led to the development of
historic atomic models is reserved for Chemistry.
All atoms of a particular element have the same atomic number; an element may have different isotopes with different mass numbers. Atoms may gain or lose
valence electrons to become anions or cations. Atomic number, mass number, charge and identity of the element can be determined from the numbers of protons,
neutrons and electrons. Atomic mass calculations and explanations about configuration of electrons and how atomic spectra are produced are reserved for
Chemistry.
PS.M.3: Periodic trends of the elements
Content from the middle school level, specifically the properties of metals, nonmetals and metalloids and their positions on the periodic table, is further expanded
in this course. The periodic table was arranged so that elements with similar chemical and physical properties are in the same group or family. When elements are
listed in order of increasing atomic number, the same sequence of properties appears over and over again; this is the periodic law. Trends in simple observable
properties, like density or melting point, can be examined within families or groups on the periodic table. These trends allow scientists to make predictions about
new elements. Metalloids are elements that have some properties of metals and some properties of nonmetals. Metals, nonmetals, metalloids, periods and groups
or families including the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, halogens and noble gases can be identified by their position on the periodic table. Elements in Groups
1, 2 and 17 have characteristic ionic charges that will be used in this course to predict the formulas of compounds. Other trends in the periodic table (e.g., atomic
radius, electronegativity, ionization energies) are reserved for Chemistry.
PS.M.4: Bonding and compounds
Middle school content introduced the concept that compounds are composed of atoms of two or more different elements joined together chemically. In this course,
the chemical joining of atoms is studied in more detail. Atoms may be bonded together by losing, gaining or sharing valence electrons to form molecules or three-
dimensional lattices. An ionic bond involves the attraction of two oppositely charged ions, typically a metal cation and a nonmetal anion formed by transferring
electrons between the atoms. An ion attracts oppositely charged ions from every direction, resulting in the formation of a three-dimensional lattice. Covalent bonds
result from the sharing of electrons between two atoms, usually nonmetals. Covalent bonding can result in the formation of structures ranging from small individual
molecules to three-dimensional lattices (e.g., diamond). The bonds in most compounds fall on a continuum between the two extreme models of bonding: ionic and
covalent.
Using the periodic table to determine ionic charge, formulas of ionic compounds containing elements from groups 1, 2, 17, hydrogen and oxygen can be predicted.
Given a chemical formula, a compound can be named using conventional systems that include Greek prefixes where appropriate. Prefixes will be limited to
represent values from one to 10. Given the name of an ionic or covalent substance, formulas can be written. Naming organic molecules is beyond this grade level
and is reserved for an advanced chemistry course. Prediction of bond types from electronegativity values, polar covalent bonds, and writing formulas/naming
compounds that contain polyatomic ions or transition metals are reserved for Chemistry.
PS.M.5: Reactions of matter
In middle school, the law of conservation of matter was expanded to chemical reactions, noting that the number and type of atoms and the total mass are the same
before and after the reaction. In this course, conservation of matter is expressed by writing balanced chemical equations. At this level, reactants and products can
                                                                                                                                           Back to Table of Contents

be identified from an equation and simple equations can be written and balanced given either the formulas of the reactants and products or a word description of
the reaction. Stoichiometric relationships beyond the coefficients in a balanced equation and classification of types of chemical reactions are reserved for
Chemistry.
During chemical reactions, thermal energy is either transferred from the system to the surroundings (exothermic) or transferred from the surroundings to the
system (endothermic). Since the environment surrounding the system can be large, temperature changes in the surroundings may not be detectable.
Nuclear reactions involve changes to the nucleus and typically produce much larger energies than chemical reactions. The strong nuclear force is an attractive
force that binds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus. While the nuclear force is extremely weak at most distances, over the very short distances present
in the nucleus the force is greater than the repulsive electrical forces among protons. When the attractive nuclear forces and repulsive electrical forces in the
nucleus are not balanced, the nucleus is unstable. Through radioactive decay, the unstable nucleus emits radiation in the form of very fast-moving particles
and energy to produce a new nucleus. Nuclei that undergo this process are said to be radioactive. Radioactive decay can result in the release of different types of
radiation (alpha, beta, gamma), each with a characteristic mass, charge, and potential to alter and penetrate the material it strikes. Alpha decay changes the
identity of the element. Beta decay results from the decay of a neutron. When a radioisotope undergoes alpha or beta decay, the resulting nucleus can be
predicted and the balanced nuclear equation can be written.
For any radioisotope, the half-life is unique and predictable. Graphs can be constructed that show the amount of a radioisotope that remains as a function of time
and can be interpreted to determine the value of the half-life. Half-life values are used in radioactive dating. Only whole number integers of half-lives will be
addressed in this course.
Other examples of nuclear processes include nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. Nuclear fission involves splitting a large nucleus into smaller nuclei, releasing
large quantities of energy. Nuclear fusion is the joining of smaller nuclei into a larger nucleus accompanied by the release of large quantities of energy. Nuclear
fusion is the process responsible for formation of elements in the universe beyond hydrogen and is the source of energy in the sun and other stars. Using nuclear
reactions as an energy resource can be addressed. Further details about nuclear processes, including mass-energy equivalence and nuclear power
applications, are addressed in Physics.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

representations.
PS.EW.1: Conservation of energy
Energy content learned in middle school, specifically conservation of energy and the basic differences between kinetic and potential energy, is elaborated on and
quantified in this course. Energy has no direction and has units of joules (J). Kinetic energy, Ek, can be mathematically represented by Ek = ½mv2. Gravitational
potential energy, Eg, can be mathematically represented by Eg = mgh. The amount of gravitational potential energy of an object is measured relative to a reference
that is considered to be at a point of zero energy. The reference may be changed to help understand different situations. Only the change in the amount of energy
can be measured absolutely. The conservation of energy and equations for kinetic and gravitational potential energy can be used to calculate values associated
with energy (e.g., height, mass, speed) for situations involving energy transfer and transformation. Opportunities to quantify energy from data collected in
experimental situations (e.g., a swinging pendulum, a car traveling down an incline) should be provided.
PS.EW.2: Transfer and transformation of energy (including work)
In middle school, concepts of energy transfer and transformation were addressed. Topics included conservation of energy, conduction, convection and radiation,
the transformation of electrical energy, and the dissipation of energy into thermal energy. Work was introduced as a method of energy transfer into or out of the
system when an outside force moves an object over a distance. In this course, these concepts are further developed. As long as the force, F, and displacement,
Δx, are in the same or opposite directions, work, W, can be calculated from the equation W = FΔx. Work can also be quantified as W = ΔE. Energy transformations
for a phenomenon can be represented through a series of pie graphs or bar graphs. Equations for work, kinetic energy and potential energy can be combined with
the law of conservation of energy to solve problems; conceptual understanding of kinetic energy, potential energy and work should be emphasized. When energy
is transferred from one system to another, some of the energy is transformed to thermal energy. Since thermal energy involves the random movement of many
trillions of subatomic particles, it is less able to be organized to bring about further change. Therefore, even though the total amount of energy remains constant,
less energy is available for doing useful work.

PW.EW.3: Waves
As addressed in middle school, waves transmit energy from one place to another, can transfer energy between objects and can be described by their speed,
wavelength, frequency and amplitude. These concepts were applied to seismic waves traveling through different materials. In elementary and middle school,
reflection and refraction of light were introduced, as was absorption of radiant energy by transformation into thermal energy. In this course, these processes are
conceptually addressed (not mathematically) from the perspective of waves and expanded to include other types of energy that travel in waves. When a wave
encounters a new material, the new material may absorb the energy of the wave by transforming it to another form of energy, usually thermal energy. Waves can
be reflected off solid barriers or refracted when a wave travels from one medium into another medium. Waves may undergo diffraction around small obstacles or
openings. When two waves traveling through the same medium meet, they pass through each other and continue traveling through the medium as before. When
the waves meet, they undergo superposition, demonstrating constructive and destructive interference. Sound travels in waves and undergoes reflection, refraction,
interference and diffraction. In Physics, many of these wave phenomena will be studied further and quantified. Radiant energy travels in waves and does not
require a medium. Sources of light energy (e.g., the sun, a light bulb) radiate energy continuously in all directions. Radiant energy has a wide range of frequencies,
wavelengths and energies arranged into the electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum is divided into bands that have different applications in
everyday life: radio (lowest energy), microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays (highest energy).
Radiant energy of the entire electromagnetic spectrum travels at the same speed in a vacuum. Specific frequency, energy, or wavelength ranges of the
electromagnetic spectrum are not required. However, the relative positions of the different bands, including the colors of visible light, are important (e.g., ultraviolet
has more energy than microwaves). Total radiant energy depends on more than just the frequency. Radiant energy exhibits wave behaviors including reflection,
refraction, absorption, superposition and diffraction. For opaque objects (e.g., paper, a chair, an apple), little if any radiant energy is transmitted into the new
material. However, the radiant energy can be absorbed, usually increasing the thermal energy of the object and/or the radiant energy can be reflected. For rough
objects, the reflection in all directions forms a diffuse reflection and for smooth shiny objects, reflections can result in clear images. Transparent materials transmit
most of the energy through the material, but smaller amounts of energy may be absorbed or reflected.
Changes in the observed frequency and wavelength of a wave can occur if the wave source and the observer are moving relative to each other. When the source
and the observer are moving toward each other, the wavelength is shorter and the observed frequency is higher; when the source and the observer are moving
away from each other, the wavelength is longer and the observed frequency is lower. This phenomenon is called the Doppler shift and can be illustrated by
listening to an ambulance siren as it travels past. As discussed in the Universe section of this course, this phenomenon is important to current understanding of
how the universe is expanding. As a result, the light we receive from distant galaxies has a noticeable shift toward redder wavelengths (the so-called “redshift”).
Calculations to measure the apparent change in frequency or wavelength are not appropriate for this course.
PS.EW.4: Thermal energy
In middle school, thermal energy is introduced as the energy of movement of the particles that make up matter. Processes of heat transfer, including conduction,
convection and radiation, were studied. In other sections of this course, the role of thermal energy during heating, cooling and phase changes is explored
conceptually and graphically. In this course, rates of thermal energy transfer and thermal equilibrium are introduced. Thermal conductivity depends on the rate at
which thermal energy is transferred from one end of a material to another. Thermal conductors have a high rate of thermal energy transfer and thermal insulators
have a slow rate of thermal energy transfer. The rate at which thermal radiation is absorbed or emitted by a system depends on its temperature, color, texture and
exposed surface area. All other things being equal, in a given amount of time, black rough surfaces absorb more thermal energy than smooth white surfaces. An
object or system is continuously absorbing and emitting thermal radiation. If the object or system absorbs more thermal energy than it emits and there is no
change in phase, the temperature increases. If the object or system emits more thermal energy than is absorbed and there is no change in phase, the temperature
decreases. For an object or system in thermal equilibrium, the amount of thermal energy absorbed is equal to the amount of thermal energy emitted; therefore, the
temperature remains constant. In Chemistry, changes in thermal energy will be quantified for substances that change their temperature.

PS.EW.5: Electricity
In earlier grades, concepts of electrical conductors and insulators were introduced. A complete loop is needed for an electrical circuit that may be in parallel or in
series. In this course, current, voltage and resistance are introduced conceptually to explain what was observed in middle school. The differences between
electrical conductors and insulators can be explained by how freely the electrons flow throughout the material due to how firmly electrons are held by the nucleus.
By convention, electric current is the rate at which positive charge flows in a circuit. In reality, it is the negatively charged electrons that are actually moving.
Current is measured in amperes (A). An ampere is equal to one coulomb of charge per second (C/s). In an electric circuit, the power source supplies the electrons
already in the circuit with electric potential energy by doing work to separate opposite charges. For a battery, the energy is provided by a chemical reaction that
separates charges on the positive and negative sides of the battery. This separation of charge is what causes the electrons to flow in the circuit. These electrons
then transfer energy to other objects and transform electrical energy into other forms (e.g., light, sound, heat) in the resistors. Current continues to flow even after
the electrons transfer their energy. Resistors oppose the rate of charge flow in the circuit. The potential difference or voltage across an energy source is a measure
of potential energy in joules supplied to each coulomb of charge. The volt (V) is the unit of potential difference and is equal to one joule of energy per coulomb of
charge (J/C). Potential difference across the circuit is a property of the energy source and does not depend upon the devices in the circuit. These concepts can be
used to explain why current will increase as the potential difference increases and as the resistance decreases. Experiments, investigations and testing (3-D or
virtual) are used to construct a variety of circuits and to measure and compare the potential difference (voltage) and current. Circuits are dealt with conceptually in
this course. Calculations are reserved for Physics.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: FORCES AND MOTION
Building upon content in elementary and middle school, major concepts of motion and forces are further developed. In middle school, speed was addressed
conceptually, mathematically and graphically. The concepts that forces have both magnitude and direction and can be represented with force diagrams, that forces
can be added to find a net force and that forces may affect motion have been addressed in middle school. At the high school level, mathematics (including
graphing) is used when describing these phenomena, moving from qualitative understanding to one that is more quantitative. For this course, motion is limited to
segments of uniform motion (e.g., at rest, constant velocity, constant acceleration) in a straight line either horizontally, vertically, up an incline or down an incline.
Motions of two objects may be compared or addressed simultaneously (e.g., when or where would they meet).
PS.FM.1: Motion
The motion of an object depends on the observer’s frame of reference and is described in terms of distance, position, displacement, speed, velocity, acceleration
and time. Position, displacement, velocity and acceleration are all vector properties (magnitude and direction). All motion is relative to whatever frame of reference
is chosen for there is no motionless frame from which to judge all motion. The relative nature of motion will be addressed conceptually, not mathematically. Non-
inertial reference frames are excluded. Motion diagrams can be drawn and interpreted to represent the position and velocity of an object. Showing acceleration on
motion diagrams is reserved for Physics.
The displacement or change in position of an object is a vector quantity that can be calculated by subtracting the initial position from the final position (Δx = xf – xi).
Displacement can be positive or negative depending upon the direction of motion. Displacement is not always equal to the distance travelled. Examples should be
given where the distance is not the same as the displacement.
Velocity is a vector quantity that represents the rate at which position changes. Average velocity can be calculated by dividing displacement (change in position) by
the elapsed time (vavg = (xf – xi)/(tf – ti)). Velocity may be positive or negative depending upon the direction of motion. Velocity should be distinguished from speed,
which is always positive. Provide examples of when the average speed is not the same as the average velocity. Objects that move with constant velocity have the
same displacement for each successive time interval. While speeding up or slowing down and/or changing direction, the velocity of an object changes
continuously, from instant to instant. The speed of an object at any instant (clock reading) is called instantaneous speed.
Acceleration is a vector quantity that represents the rate at which velocity changes. Average acceleration can be calculated by dividing the change in velocity by
elapsed time
(aavg = (vf– vi)/(tf – ti)). At this grade level, it should be noted that acceleration can be positive or negative, but specifics about what kind of motions produce positive
or negative accelerations will be addressed in Physics. Deceleration is an ambiguous term that should only be used when an object is slowing down. Care should
                                                                                                                                                  Back to Table of Contents


OHIO’S LEARNING STANDARDS | SCIENCE | ADOPTED 2018                                                                                                                      223
be given to ensure students do not associate negative acceleration with only deceleration. Objects with negative acceleration could be increasing their speed.
Objects that have no acceleration can either be standing still or be moving with constant velocity (speed and direction). Constant acceleration occurs when the
change in an object’s instantaneous velocity is the same for equal successive time intervals. Motion can be represented by position vs. time and velocity vs. time
graphs. Specifics about the speed, direction and change in motion can be determined by interpreting such graphs. For this course, graphs will be limited to positive
x-values and show only uniform motion involving segments of constant velocity or constant acceleration. Motion can be investigated by collecting and analyzing
data in the laboratory and should include constant velocity as well as constant acceleration. Technology can enhance motion exploration and investigation through
video analysis, the use of motion detectors and graphing data for analysis.
Objects that move with constant velocity and have no acceleration form a straight line (not necessarily horizontal) on a position vs. time graph. Objects that are at
rest will form a horizontal line on a position vs. time graph. Objects that are accelerating will show a curved line on a position vs. time graph. Velocity can be
calculated by determining the slope of a position vs. time graph. Positive slopes on position vs. time graphs indicate motion in a positive direction. Negative slopes
on position vs. time graphs indicate motion in a negative direction. While it is important that students can construct graphs by hand, computer graphing programs
or graphing calculators can also be used so more time can be spent on graph interpretation and analysis. Constant acceleration is represented by a straight line
(not necessarily horizontal) on a velocity vs. time graph. Objects that have no acceleration (at rest or moving at a constant velocity) will have a horizontal line for a
velocity vs. time graph. Average acceleration can be determined from the slope of a velocity vs. time graph. The details about motion graphs should not be taught
as rules to memorize, but rather as generalizations that can be developed from interpreting the graphs.
PS.FM.2: Forces
Force is a vector quantity, having both magnitude and direction. Force diagrams are useful tools for visualizing and analyzing the forces acting on objects. The (SI)
unit of force is a newton. One newton of net force will cause a 1 kg object to experience an acceleration of 1 m/s2. A newton can also be represented as kg·m/s2.
The opportunity to measure force in the lab is provided (e.g., with a spring scale or a force probe). Normal forces and tension forces are introduced conceptually at
this level. These forces and other forces introduced in prior grades (friction, drag, gravitational, electric and magnetic) can be used as examples of forces that
affect motion.
In this course, only forces in one dimension (positive and negative) will be addressed. The net force can be determined by one-dimensional vector addition.
Gravitational force (weight) can be calculated from mass, but all other forces will only be quantified from force diagrams. Friction is a force that opposes motion.
Kinetic friction (e.g., sliding, rolling), drag and static friction can be addressed conceptually. More quantitative study of friction forces, universal gravitational forces,
elastic forces and electrical forces is reserved for Physics.
A normal force exists between two solid objects when their surfaces are pressed together due to other forces acting on one or both objects (e.g., a solid sitting on
or sliding across a table, a ladder leaning against a wall, a ball hitting a bat). A normal force is always a push directed at right angles from the surfaces of the
interacting objects. A tension force occurs when a non-slack rope, wire, cord or similar device pulls on another object.
In middle school, the concept of a field as a region of space that surrounds objects with the appropriate property (mass for gravitational fields, charge for electric
fields, a magnetic object for magnetic fields) was introduced to explain gravitational, magnetic and electrical forces that occur over a distance. In high school, the
field concept is further developed. The stronger the field, the greater the force exerted on objects placed in the field. The field of an object is always there even if
the object is not interacting with anything else. The gravitational force (weight) of an object is proportional to its mass. Weight, Fg, can be calculated from the
equation Fg = mg, where g is the gravitational field strength of an object which is equal to 9.8 N/kg or 9.8 m/s2 on the surface of Earth.
PS.FM.3: Dynamics (how forces affect motion)
The focus of the content is to develop a conceptual understanding of the laws of motion to explain and predict changes in motion, not to name or recite a
memorized definition. When the vector sum of the forces (net force, Fnet) acting on an object is zero, the object does not accelerate. For an object that is moving,
this means the object will remain moving without changing its speed or direction. For an object that is not moving, the object will continue to remain stationary.
An object will accelerate (increase or decrease its speed or change its direction of motion) when an unbalanced net force acts on it. The rate at which an object
changes its speed or direction (acceleration) is proportional to the vector sum of the forces (net force, Fnet) and inversely proportional to the mass (a = Fnet/m).
                                                                                                                                                 Back to Table of Contents


OHIO’S LEARNING STANDARDS | SCIENCE | ADOPTED 2018                                                                                                                      224
These laws will be applied to systems consisting of a single object upon which multiple forces act. Vector addition will be limited to one dimension (positive and
negative). While both horizontal and vertical forces can be acting on an object simultaneously, for this level, one of the dimensions must have a net force of zero.
A force is an interaction between two objects. Both objects in the interaction experience an equal amount of force, but in opposite directions. Interacting force pairs
are often confused with balanced forces. Interacting force pairs can never cancel each other out because they always act on different objects. Naming the force
(e.g., gravity, friction) does not identify the two objects involved in the interacting force pair. Objects involved in an interacting force pair can be easily identified by
using the format “A acts on B so B acts on A.” For example, the truck hits the sign therefore the sign hits the truck with an equal force in the opposite direction.
Earth pulls the book down so the book pulls Earth up with an equal force. In Physics, all laws will be applied to systems of many objects.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: THE UNIVERSE
In early elementary school, observations of the sky and space are the foundation for developing a deeper knowledge of the solar system. In late elementary
school, the parts of the solar system are introduced, including characteristics of the sun and planets, orbits and celestial bodies. At the middle school level, energy,
waves, gravity and density are emphasized in the physical sciences, and characteristics and patterns within the solar system are explored. In this course, the
universe and galaxies are introduced, building upon the knowledge about space and the solar system from earlier grades.
PS.U.1: History of the Universe
The big bang model is a broadly accepted theory for the origin and evolution of our universe. It postulates that 12 to 14 billion years ago, the portion of the universe
seen today was only a few millimeters across (NASA). According to the “big bang” theory, the contents of the known universe expanded explosively into existence
from a hot, dense state 13.7 billion years ago (NAEP, 2009). After the big bang, the universe expanded quickly (and continues to expand) and then cooled down
enough for atoms to form. Gravity pulled the atoms together into gas clouds that eventually became stars, which comprise young galaxies. Foundations for the big
bang model can be included to introduce the supporting evidence for the expansion of the known universe (e.g., Hubble’s law and red shift or cosmic microwave
background radiation). A discussion of Hubble’s law and red shift is found in the Galaxies section, below. Technology provides the basis for many new discoveries
related to space and the universe. Visual, radio and x-ray telescopes collect information from across the entire electromagnetic spectrum; computers are used to
manage data and complicated computations; space probes send back data and materials from remote parts of the solar system; and accelerators provide
subatomic particle energies that simulate conditions in the stars and in the early history of the universe before stars formed.
PS.U.2: Galaxies
A galaxy is a group of billions of individual stars, star systems, star clusters, dust and gas bound together by gravity. There are billions of galaxies in the universe
(NAEP 2009, page 52), and they are classified by size and shape. Most observed galaxies are classified as elliptical, spiral and irregular. The Milky Way is a spiral
galaxy. It has more than 100 billion stars and a diameter of more than 100,000 light years. At the center of the Milky Way is a massive black hole around which is a
collection of stars bulging outward from the disk, from which extend spiral arms of gas, dust and most of the young stars. The solar system is part of the Milky Way
galaxy. Hubble’s law states that galaxies that are farther away have a greater red shift, so the speed at which a galaxy is moving away is proportional to its
distance from Earth. Red shift is a phenomenon due to Doppler shifting, so the shift of light from a galaxy to the red end of the spectrum indicates that the galaxy
and the observer are moving farther away from one another. Doppler shifting is also found in the Energy and Waves section of this course.
                                                                                                                                             Back to Table of Contents

PS.U.3: Stars
Early in the formation of the universe, stars coalesced out of clouds of hydrogen and helium and clumped together by gravitational attraction into galaxies. When
heated to a sufficiently high temperature by gravitational attraction, stars begin nuclear reactions, which convert matter to energy and fuse the lighter elements into
heavier ones. All elements, except for hydrogen and some helium and lithium, originated from nuclear fusion reactions of stars.
Stars are classified by their color, size, luminosity and mass. A Hertzprung-Russell diagram can be used to estimate the sizes of stars and predict how stars will
evolve. Most stars fall on the main sequence of the H-R diagram, a diagonal band running from the bright hot stars on the upper left to the dim cool stars on the
lower right. Stars like the sun will eventually collapse to become a white dwarf, while more massive stars will collapse to form neutron stars or black holes. For
stars like the sun, this process of collapse will produce a nebula. More massive stars will collapse with a supernova explosion. The gas ejected from the system
during the end stages of the star’s life may eventually coalesce under gravity to form new stars, and the stellar life cycle with begin again.
Note: Names of stars and naming the evolutionary stage of a star from memory is not the focus. The emphasis is on the interpretation of data (using diagrams and
charts) and the criteria and processes needed to make those determinations.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

  One goal of science education is to help students become scientifically literate citizens able to use science as a way of knowing about the natural and material
  world. All students should have sufficient understanding of scientific knowledge and scientific processes to enable them to distinguish what is science from what
  is not science and to make informed decisions about career choices, health maintenance, quality of life, community and other decisions that impact both
  themselves and others.

CONTENT ELABORATION: HEREDITY
Building on knowledge from elementary school (plants and animals have life cycles and offspring resemble their parents) and knowledge from middle school
(reproduction, Mendelian genetics, inherited traits and diversity of species), Heredity focuses on the explanation of genetic patterns of inheritance. In middle
school, students learn that living things are a result of one or two parents, and traits are passed to the next generation through either asexual or sexual
reproduction. Foundational concepts of mitosis and meiosis are introduced in grades 6 and 8. In addition, they learned that traits are defined by instructions
encoded in many discrete genes and that a gene may come in more than one form called alleles.
B.H.1: Cellular genetics
Life is specified by genomes. Each organism has a genome that contains all the biological information needed to develop and maintain that organism. The
biological information contained in a genome is encoded in its deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and is divided into discrete units called genes. Genes code for proteins.
Different parts of the genetic instructions are used in different types of cells, influenced by the cell’s environment and history. The many body cells in an individual
can be very different from one another, even though they are all descended from a single cell and thus have essentially identical genetic instructions. (AAAS)
B.H.2: Structure and function of DNA in cells
Mendel’s laws of inheritance (introduced in grade 8) are interwoven with current knowledge of DNA and chromosome structure and function to build toward basic
knowledge of modern genetics. Genes are segments of DNA molecules. The sequence of DNA bases in a chromosome determines the sequence of amino acids
in a protein. Inserting, deleting or substituting segments of DNA molecules can alter genes. Sorting and recombination of genes in sexual reproduction and meiosis
specifically result in a variance in traits of the offspring of any two parents. This content can be explicitly connected to evolution.
B.H.3: Genetic mechanisms and inheritance
Genetic variation in traits among offspring is a result of the movement of chromosomes crossing over, independent assortment, and recombination during gamete
formation. Gene interactions described in middle school were limited primarily to dominant and codominant traits. In high school, genetic mechanisms, both
classical and modern, including incomplete dominance, sex-linked traits, and dihybrid crosses, are investigated through real-world examples. Statistics and
probability allow us to compare observations made in the real world with predicted outcomes. Dihybrid crosses can be used to explore linkage groups, gene
interactions and phenotypic variations. Chromosome maps reveal linkage groups.
B.H.4: Mutations
Genes can be altered by insertion, deletion, or substitution of a segment of DNA molecules. An altered gene is a mutation and will be passed on to every cell that
develops from it. The resulting features may help, harm or have little or no effect on the offspring’s success in its environments. Gene mutations in gametes are
passed on to offspring.
B.H.5: Modern genetics
Technological developments that lead to the current knowledge of heredity are introduced for study. The development of the model for DNA structure was the
result of experimentation, hypothesis, testing, statistical analysis and technology as well as the studies and ideas of many scientists. James Watson and Francis
Crick developed the current model based on the work of Rosalind Franklin and others. Scientists continue to extend the model and use it to devise technologies to
                                                                                                                                            Back to Table of Contents

interpretation and application of the results.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: EVOLUTION
The basic concept of biological evolution is that Earth’s present-day species descended from earlier, common ancestral species. At the elementary school level,
evolution concepts include the relationship between organisms and the environment, interactions among parents and offspring and an introduction to the fossil
record and extinction. At the middle school level, concepts include biodiversity (as part of biomes) and speciation, further exploration of the fossil record and
Earth's history, changing environmental conditions (abiotic factors), natural selection and biological evolution. At the high school level, the study of evolution
includes Modern Synthesis, the unification of genetics and evolution, historical perspectives of evolutionary theory, gene flow, mutation, speciation, natural
selection, genetic drift and sexual selection.
B.E.1: Mechanisms
Natural selection is used to describe the process by which traits become more or less common in a population due to consistent environmental pressures upon the
survival and reproduction of individuals with the trait. Mathematical reasoning is applied to solve problems (e.g., use Hardy-Weinberg principle to explain
deviations in observed gene frequency patterns in a population compared to expected patterns based on the assumptions of the principle). Populations evolve
over time. Evolution through natural selection is the consequence of the interactions of:
          1. The potential for a population to increase its numbers;
          2. The genetic variability of offspring due to mutation and recombination of genes;
          3. A finite supply of the resources required for life; and
          4. The differential survival and reproduction of individuals based on phenotype(s).
Mutations are described in the content elaboration for Heredity. Apply the knowledge of mutation and genetic drift to real-world examples. Biological evolution
explains the natural origins for the diversity of life. Emphasis shifts from thinking in terms of selection of individuals with a particular trait to changing proportions of
a trait in populations as a result of the mechanisms of natural selection, genetic drift, movement of genes into and out of populations and sexual selection.
B.E.2: Speciation
Biological classification expanded to molecular evidence
Classification systems are frameworks, developed by scientists, for describing the diversity of organisms; indicating the degree of relatedness among organisms.
Recent molecular sequence data generally support earlier hypotheses regarding lineages of organisms based upon morphological comparisons. Both
morphological and molecular comparisons can be used to describe patterns of biodiversity (cladograms present hypotheses to explain descent from a common
ancestor with modification). The concept of descent from a common ancestor with modification provides a natural explanation for the diversity of life on Earth as
partially represented in the fossil record and in the similarities of existing species.
                                                                                                                                                  Back to Table of Contents

Variation of organisms within a species due to population genetics and gene frequency
Different phenotypes result from new combinations of existing genes or from mutations of genes in reproductive cells. At the high school level, the expectation is to
combine grade 8 knowledge with an explanation of genes and the function of chromosomes. Natural selection works on the phenotype.
Heritable characteristics influence how likely an organism is to survive and reproduce in a particular environment. When an environment changes, the survival
value of inherited characteristics may change. This may or may not cause a change in species that inhabit the environment. Use real-world examples to illustrate
natural selection, gene flow, sexual selection, and genetic drift.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: DIVERSITY AND INTERDEPENDENCE OF LIFE
Building on knowledge from elementary school (interactions of organisms within their environment and the law of conservation of matter and energy, food webs)
and from middle school (flow of energy through organisms, biomes and biogeochemical cycles), this topic at the high school level focuses on the study of diversity
and similarity at the molecular level of organisms. Additionally, the effects of physical/chemical constraints on all biological relationships and systems are
investigated. The unidirectional flow of energy and the cycling of matter as organisms grow, reproduce and die occurs at all levels of biological organization.
Previous knowledge focused on biological systems at equilibrium; at the high school level, biological systems not at equilibrium and their responses are
considered. Diagrams and models are used to explain the effects of real-world interactions and events within an ecosystem.
B.DI.1: Biodiversity
The great diversity of organisms and ecological niches they occupy result from more than 3.8 billion years of evolution. Populations of individual species and
groups of species comprise a vast reserve of genetic diversity. Loss of diversity alters energy flow, cycles of matter and persistence within biological communities.
Loss of genetic diversity in a population increases its probability of extinction.
B.DI.2: Ecosystems
Ecosystems change as geological and biological conditions vary due to natural and anthropogenic factors. Like many complex systems, ecosystems have cyclical
fluctuations around a state of equilibrium. The rate of these fluctuations in ecosystems can increase due to anthropogenic factors. Changes in ecosystems may
lead to disequilibrium, which can be seen in variations in carrying capacities for many species. Authentic data are used to study the rate of change in matter and
energy relationships, population dynamics, carbon and nitrogen cycling, population changes and growth within an ecosystem. Graphs, charts, histograms and
algebraic thinking are used to explain concepts of carrying capacity of populations and homeostasis within ecosystems by investigating changes in populations
that occur locally or regionally. Mathematical models can include the exponential growth model and the logistic growth model. The simplest version of the logistic
growth model is Population Growth Rate = rN(K-N)/K, which incorporates the biological concept of limited (non-infinite) carrying capacity, based upon intra- and
interspecies competition for resources such as food, as represented by the variable K. Carrying capacity is defined as the population equilibrium size when births
and deaths are equal; hence Population Growth Rate = zero.
B.DI.3: Loss of diversity
An ecosystem will maintain equilibrium with small fluctuations in its abiotic and biotic components, but significant fluctuations can result in long-term alterations of
the ecosystem and ultimately a loss of biodiversity. This can be caused by natural and anthropogenic events. Humans are a biotic factor in ecosystems and can
impact critical variables within these systems. Climate is dependent on a number of feedback loops between sunlight, the ocean, the atmosphere and the
biosphere. Increasing mean global temperatures cause increased variance in weather that impacts both biotic and abiotic factors. Multiple changes happening
                                                                                                                                              Back to Table of Contents

simultaneously can stress ecosystems. Extreme events such as prolonged drought, floods, or the introduction or removal of species can result in long-term
alterations to ecosystems and their functions. The current rate of extinction is at least 100-1000 times the average background rate observed in the fossil record.
The observed rates of biodiversity loss are indicative of a severe and pervasive disequilibrium in ecosystems. At the high school level, students should examine
the factors that contribute to the accelerated extinction rates observed today and the implications of declining biodiversity carrying capacity. Misconceptions about
population growth capacity, interspecies and intraspecies competition for resources, and what occurs when members of a species immigrate to or emigrate from
ecosystems are included in this topic. Technology can be used to access real-time/authentic data to study population changes and growth in specific locations.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: CELLS
Building on knowledge from middle school (cell theory, cell division and differentiation), this topic focuses on the cell as a system itself (single-celled organism) and
as part of larger systems (multicellular organism), sometimes as part of a multicellular organism, always as part of an ecosystem. The cell is a system that
conducts a variety of functions associated with life. Details of cellular processes such as photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, cellular respiration and biosynthesis of
macromolecules are addressed at this grade level. The concept of the cell and its parts as a functioning biochemical system is more important than just
memorizing the parts of the cell.
B.C.1: Cell structure and function
Every cell produces a membrane through which substances pass differentially, maintaining homeostasis. Molecular properties and concentration of the substances
determine which molecules pass freely and which molecules require the input of energy. In all but quite primitive cells, a complex network of proteins provides
organization and shape. Within the cell are specialized parts that transport materials, transform energy, build proteins, dispose of waste and provide information
feedback and movement. Many chemical reactions that occur in some cells of multicellular organisms do not occur in most of the other cells of the organism.
Prokaryotes, simple single-celled organisms, are first found in the fossil record about 3.8 billion years ago. Cells with nuclei, eukaryotes, developed one billion
years ago and from these increasingly complex multicellular organisms descended.
B.C.2: Cellular processes
Living cells interact with, and can have an impact on, their environment. Carbon is a necessary element that cells acquire from their environment. Cells use
carbon, along with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous and sulfur, during essential processes like respiration, photosynthesis, chemosynthesis and
biosynthesis of macromolecules (e.g., proteins, lipids, carbohydrates). Chemical reactions that occur within a cell can cause the storage or release of energy by
forming or breaking chemical bonds. Specialized proteins called enzymes lower the activation energy required for chemical reactions, increasing the reaction rate.
Positive and negative feedback mechanisms regulate internal cell functions as external conditions vary. Most cells function within a narrow range of temperature
and pH. Variations in external conditions that exceed the optimal range for a cell can affect the rate at which essential chemical reactions occur in that cell. At very
low temperatures, reaction rates are slow. High temperatures can irreversibly change the structure of most protein molecules. Changes in pH beyond the optimal
range of the cell can alter the structure of most protein molecules and change how molecules within the cell interact.
The sequence of DNA bases on a chromosome determines the sequence of amino acids in a protein. Enzymatic proteins catalyze most chemical reactions in
cells. Protein molecules are long, folded chains made from combinations of 20 common amino-acids. The activity of each protein molecule results from its
sequence of amino acids and the shape the chain takes as a result of that sequence.
Note 1: The idea that protein molecules assembled by cells conduct the work that goes on inside and outside the cells in an organism can be learned without

different shapes of the molecules influence what they do.

Note 2: Emphasis is on inputs and outputs of matter and the transfer and transformation of energy in biological processes. Specific steps, names of enzymes, and
intermediates of the pathways for these processes are beyond the scope of the standards.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF MATTER
C.PM.1: Atomic structure
Physical Science included properties and locations of protons, neutrons and electrons, atomic number, mass number, cations and anions, isotopes and the strong
nuclear force which holds the nucleus together. In this course, the historical development of the atomic model and the positions of electrons are explored in greater
detail.
Atomic models are constructed to explain experimental evidence and make predictions. The changes in the atomic model over time exemplify how scientific
knowledge changes as new evidence emerges and how technological advancements like electricity extend the boundaries of scientific knowledge. Thompson’s
study of electrical discharges in cathode-ray tubes led to the discovery of the electron and the development of the plum pudding model of the atom. Rutherford’s
experiment, in which he bombarded gold foil with α-particles, led to the discovery that most of the atom consists of empty space with a relatively small, positively
charged nucleus. Bohr used data from atomic spectra to propose a planetary model of the atom in which electrons orbit the nucleus, like planets around the sun.
Later, Schrödinger used the idea that electrons travel in waves to develop a model in which electrons travel randomly in regions of space called orbitals (quantum
mechanical model).
Based on the quantum mechanical model, it is not possible to predict exactly where electrons are located but there is a region of space surrounding the nucleus in
which there is a high probability of finding an electron (electron cloud or orbital). Data from atomic spectra (emission and absorption) gives evidence that electrons
can only exist at certain discrete energy levels and not at energies between these levels.
Atoms are usually in the ground state where the electrons occupy orbitals with the lowest available energy. However, the atom can become excited when the
electrons absorb a photon with the precise amount of energy (indicated by the frequency of the photon) to move to an orbital with higher energy. Any photon
without this precise amount of energy will be ignored by the electron. The atom exists in the excited state for a very short amount of time. When an electron drops
back down to the lower energy level, it emits a photon that has energy equal to the energy difference between the levels. The amount of energy is indicated by the
frequency of the light that is given off and can be measured. Each element has a unique emission and absorption spectrum due to its unique electron configuration
and specific electron energy jumps that are possible for that element.
Being aware of the quantum mechanical model as the currently accepted model for the atom is important for science literacy as it explains and predicts subatomic
interactions, but details should be reserved for more advanced study.
Electron energy levels consist of sublevels (s, p, d and f), each with a characteristic number and shape of orbitals. Orbital diagrams and electron configuration can
be constructed to show the location of the electrons in an atom using established rules. Valence electrons are responsible for most of the chemical properties of
elements. In this course, electron configuration (extended and noble gas notation) and orbital diagrams can be shown for any element in the first three periods.
Although the quantum mechanical model of the atom explains the most experimental evidence, other models can still be helpful. Thinking of atoms as indivisible
spheres is useful in explaining many physical properties of substances, such as the state (solid, liquid or gas) of a substance at room temperature. Bohr’s
planetary model is useful to explain and predict periodic trends in the properties of elements.
Note: Quantum numbers and equations of de Broglie, Schrödinger and Plank are beyond the scope of this course.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

C.PM.2: Periodic table
In the Physical Science course, the concept that elements are placed in order of increasing atomic number in the periodic table such that elements with similar
properties are placed in the same column is introduced. How the periodic table is divided into groups, families, periods, metals, nonmetals and metalloids is also
included and will be revisited here. In this course, with more information about the electron configuration of elements, similarities in the configuration of the valence
electrons for a particular group can be observed. The electron configuration of an atom can be determined from the position on the periodic table. The repeating
pattern in the electron configuration for elements on the periodic table explains many of the trends in the properties observed. Atomic theory is used to describe
and explain trends in properties across periods or down columns including atomic radii, ionic radii, first ionization energies, electronegativities and whether the
element is a solid or gas at room temperature. Additional ionization energies, electron affinities and periodic properties of the transition elements, and the
lanthanide and actinide series are reserved for more advanced study.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.

CONTENT ELABORATION: STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF MATTER
C.PM.3: Chemical bonding
Content in the Physical Science course included recognizing that atoms with unpaired electrons tend to form ionic and covalent bonds with other atoms, forming
molecules, ionic lattices or network covalent structures. In this course, electron configuration, electronegativity values and energy considerations will be applied to
bonding and the properties of materials with different types of bonding.
Atoms of many elements are more stable when they are bonded to other atoms. In such cases, as atoms bond, energy is released to the surroundings, resulting in
a system with lower energy. An atom’s electron configuration, particularly the valence electrons, determines how an atom interacts with other atoms. Molecules,
ionic lattices and network covalent structures have different, yet predictable, properties that depend on the identity of the elements and the types of bonds formed.
Differences in electronegativity values can be used to predict where a bond fits on the continuum between ionic and covalent bonds. The polarity of a bond
depends on the electronegativity difference and the distance between the atoms (bond length). Polar covalent bonds are introduced as an intermediary between
ionic and pure covalent bonds. The concept of metallic bonding is also introduced to explain many of the properties of metals (e.g., conductivity). Since most
compounds contain multiple bonds, a substance may contain more than one type of bond. Carbon atoms can bond together and with other atoms, especially
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, to form chains, rings and branching networks that are present in a variety of important compounds, including synthetic
polymers, fossil fuels and the large molecules essential to life. Detailed study of the structure of molecules responsible for life is reserved for more advanced
courses.

CONTENT ELABORATION: STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF MATTER
C.PM.4: Representing compounds
Using the periodic table, formulas of ionic compounds containing specific elements can be predicted. This can include ionic compounds made up of elements from
groups 1, 2, 17, hydrogen, oxygen and polyatomic ions (given the formula and charge of the polyatomic ion). Given the formula, a compound can be named using
conventional systems that include Greek prefixes and Roman numerals where appropriate. Given the name of an ionic or covalent substance, formulas can be
written.
Many different models can be used to represent compounds including chemical formulas, Lewis structures, and ball and stick models. These models can be used
to visualize atoms and molecules and to predict the properties of substances. Each type of representation provides unique information about the compound.
Different representations are better suited for particular substances. Lewis structures can be drawn to represent covalent compounds using a simple set of rules
and can be combined with valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory to predict the three-dimensional electron pair and molecular geometry of
compounds. Lewis structures and molecular geometries will only be constructed for the following combination of elements: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,
phosphorus, sulfur and the halogens. Organic nomenclature is reserved for more advanced courses.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

C.PM.5: Quantifying matter
In earlier grades, properties of materials were quantified with measurements that were always associated with some error. In this course, scientific protocols for
quantifying the properties of matter accurately and precisely are studied. Using the International System of Units (SI), significant digits or figures, scientific notation,
error analysis and dimensional analysis are vital to scientific communication.
There are three domains of magnitude in size and time: the macroscopic (human) domain, the cosmic domain and the submicroscopic (atomic and subatomic)
domain. Measurements in the cosmic domain and submicroscopic domains require complex instruments and/or procedures.
Matter can be quantified in a way that macroscopic properties such as mass can reflect the number of particles present. Elemental samples are a mixture of
several isotopes with different masses. The atomic mass of an element is calculated given the mass and relative abundance of each isotope of the element as it
exists in nature. Because the mass of an atom is very small, the mole is used to translate between the atomic and macroscopic levels. A mole is equal to the
number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of the isotope carbon-12. The mass of one mole of a substance is equal to its molar mass in grams. The molar mass for a
substance can be used in conjunction with Avogadro’s number and the density of a substance to convert between mass, moles, volume and number of particles of
a sample.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF MATTER
C.PM.6: Intermolecular forces of attraction
In middle school, solids, liquids and gases were explored in relation to the spacing of the particles, motion of the particles and strength of attraction between the
particles that make up the substance. The intermolecular forces of attraction between particles that determine whether a substance is a solid, liquid or gas at room
temperature are addressed in greater detail in this course. Intermolecular attractions are generally weak when compared to intramolecular bonds, but span a wide
range of strengths.
The composition of a substance and the shape and polarity of a molecule are particularly important in determining the type and strength of bonding and
intermolecular interactions. Types of intermolecular attractions include London dispersion forces (present between all molecules), dipole-dipole forces (present
between polar molecules) and hydrogen bonding (a special case of dipole-dipole where hydrogen is bonded to a highly electronegative atom such as fluorine,
oxygen or nitrogen), each with its own characteristic relative strength.
The configuration of atoms in a molecule determines the strength of the forces (bonds or intermolecular forces) between the particles and therefore the physical
properties (e.g., melting point, boiling point, solubility, vapor pressure) of a material. For a given substance, the average kinetic energy (temperature) needed for a
change of state to occur depends upon the strength of the intermolecular forces between the particles. Therefore, the melting point and boiling point depend upon
the amount of energy that is needed to overcome the attractions between the particles. Substances that have strong intermolecular forces or are made up of three-
dimensional networks of ionic or covalent bonds, tend to be solids at room temperature and have high melting and boiling points. Nonpolar organic molecules are
held together by weak London dispersion forces. However, substances with longer chains provide more opportunities for these attractions and tend to have higher
melting and boiling points. Increased branching of organic molecules results in lower melting and boiling points due to interference with the intermolecular
attractions.
Substances will have a greater solubility when dissolving in a solvent with similar intermolecular forces. If the substances have different intermolecular forces, they
are more likely to interact with themselves than the other substance and remain separated from each other. Water is a polar molecule and it is often used as a
solvent since most ionic and polar covalent substances will dissolve in it. In order for an ionic substance to dissolve in water, the attractive forces between the ions
must be overcome by the dipole-dipole interactions with the water. Dissolving of a solute in water is an example of a process that is difficult to classify as a
chemical or physical change and it is not appropriate to have students classify it one way or another.
Evaporation occurs when the particles with enough kinetic energy to overcome the attractive forces separate from the rest of the sample to become a gas. The
pressure of these particles is called vapor pressure. Vapor pressure increases with temperature. Particles with larger intermolecular forces have lower vapor
pressures at a given temperature since the particles require more energy to overcome the attractive forces between them. Molecular substances often evaporate
more due to the weak attractions between the particles and can often be detected by their odor. Ionic or network covalent substances have stronger forces and are
not as likely to volatilize. These substances often have little, if any, odor. Liquids boil when their vapor pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure. In solid water,
there is a network of hydrogen bonds between the particles that gives it an open structure. This is why water expands as it freezes and why solid water has a lower
density than liquid water. This has important implications for life (e.g., ice floating on water acts as an insulator in bodies of water to keep the temperature of the
rest of the water above freezing).

CONTENT ELABORATION: INTERACTIONS OF MATTER
C.IM.1: Chemical reactions
In the Physical Science course, coefficients were used to balance simple equations. Other representations, including Lewis structures and three-dimensional
models, were also used and manipulated to demonstrate the conservation of matter in chemical reactions. In this course, more complex reactions will be studied,
classified and represented with balanced chemical equations and three-dimensional models.
Classifying reactions into types can be a helpful organizational tool for recognizing patterns of what may happen when two substances are mixed. Teachers should
be aware that the common reaction classifications that are often used in high school chemistry courses may lead to misconceptions because they are not based
on the actual chemistry, but on surface features that can be similar from one system to another (e.g., exchanging partners), even though the underlying chemistry
is not the same. However, these classifications may be useful in making predictions about what happens when two substances are mixed.
Some general types of chemical reactions are oxidation/reduction, synthesis, decomposition, single replacement, double replacement (including precipitation
reactions and some acid-base neutralizations) and combustion reactions. Some reactions can fit into more than one category. For example, a single replacement
reaction can also be classified as an oxidation/reduction reaction. Identification of reactions involving oxidation and reduction as well as indicating what substance
is being oxidized and what is being reduced are appropriate in this course. However, balancing complex oxidation/reduction reactions is reserved for more
advanced study.
Organic molecules release energy when undergoing combustion reactions and are used to meet the energy needs of society (e.g., oil, gasoline, natural gas) and
to provide the energy needs of biological organisms (e.g., cellular respiration). When a reaction between two ionic compounds in aqueous solution results in the
formation of a precipitate or molecular compound, the reaction often occurs because the new ionic or covalent bonds are stronger than the original ion-dipole
interactions of the ions in solution. Laboratory experiences (3-D or virtual) with different types of chemical reactions should be provided.
Reactions occur when reacting particles collide in an appropriate orientation and with sufficient energy. The rate of a chemical reaction is the change in the amount
of the reactants or products in a specific period of time. Increasing the probability or effectiveness of the collisions between the particles increases the rate of the
reaction. Therefore, changing the concentration of the reactants, changing the temperature or the pressure of gaseous reactants, or using a catalyst, can change
the reaction rate. Likewise, the collision theory can be applied to dissolving solids in a liquid solvent and can be used to explain why reactions are more likely to
occur between reactants in the aqueous or gaseous state than between solids. The rate at which a substance dissolves should not be confused with the amount of
solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent (solubility). Mathematical treatment of reaction rates is reserved for more advanced study. Computer
simulations can help visualize reactions from the perspective of the kinetic-molecular theory.
In middle school, the differences between potential and kinetic energy and the particle nature of thermal energy were introduced. For chemical systems, potential
energy is in the form of chemical energy and kinetic energy is in the form of thermal energy. The total amount of chemical energy and/or thermal energy in a
system is impossible to measure. However, the energy change of a system can be calculated from measurements (mass and change in temperature) from
calorimetry experiments in the laboratory. Conservation of energy is an important component of calorimetry equations. Thermal energy is the energy of a system
due to the movement of its particles. The thermal energy of an object depends upon the amount of matter present (mass), temperature and chemical composition.
                                                                                                                                              Back to Table of Contents


OHIO’S LEARNING STANDARDS | SCIENCE | ADOPTED 2018                                                                                                               278
Some materials require little energy to change their temperature and other materials require a great deal to change their temperature by the same amount.
Specific heat is a measure of how much energy is needed to change the temperature of a specific mass of material a specific amount. Specific heat values can be
used to calculate the thermal energy change, the temperature (initial, final or change in) or mass of a material in calorimetry. Water has a particularly high specific
heat capacity, which is important in regulating Earth’s temperature.
As studied in middle school, chemical energy is the potential energy associated with chemical systems. Chemical reactions involve valence electrons forming
bonds to yield more stable products with lower energies. Energy is required to break interactions and bonds between the reactant atoms and energy is released
when an interaction or bond is formed between the atoms in the products. Molecules with weak bonds (e.g., ATP) are less stable and tend to react to produce
more stable products, releasing energy in the process. Generally, energy is transferred out of the system (exothermic) when the products have stronger bonds
than the reactants and is transferred into the system (endothermic) when the reactants have stronger bonds than the products. Predictions of the energy
requirements (endothermic or exothermic) of a reaction can be made given a table of bond energies. Graphic representations can be drawn and interpreted to
represent the energy changes during a reaction. The role of energy in determining the spontaneity of chemical reactions is dealt with conceptually in this course.
Entropy and its influence on the spontaneity of reactions are reserved for more advanced study.
All reactions are reversible to a degree and many reactions do not proceed completely toward products but appear to stop progressing before the reactants are all
used up. At this point, the amounts of the reactants and the products appear to be constant and the reaction can be said to have reached dynamic equilibrium.
Dynamic equilibrium means the rate of the reverse reaction is equal to the rate of the forward reaction so there is no apparent change in the reaction.
If a chemical system at equilibrium is disturbed by a change in the conditions of the system (e.g., increase or decrease in the temperature, pressure on gaseous
equilibrium systems, concentration of a reactant or product), then the equilibrium system will respond by shifting to a new equilibrium state, reducing the effect of
the change (Le Chatelier’s Principle). If products are removed as they are formed during a reaction, then the equilibrium position of the system is forced to shift to
favor the products. In this way, an otherwise unfavorable reaction can be made to occur. Mathematical treatment of equilibrium reactions is reserved for advanced
study. Computer simulations can help visualize the progression of a reaction to dynamic equilibrium and the continuation of both the forward and reverse reactions
after equilibrium has been attained.
Properties of acids and bases and the ranges of the pH scale were introduced in Physical Science. In this course, the structural features of molecules are explored
to further understand acids and bases. Acids often result when hydrogen is covalently bonded to an electronegative element and is easily dissociated from the rest
of the molecule to bind with water to form a hydronium ion (H3O+). The acidity of an aqueous solution can be expressed as pH, where pH can be calculated from
the concentration of the hydronium ion. Bases are likely to dissociate in water to form a hydroxide ion. Acids can react with bases to form a salt and water. Such
neutralization reactions can be studied quantitatively by performing titration experiments. Detailed instruction about the equilibrium of acids and bases and the
concept of Brønsted-Lowry and Lewis acids and bases is not the focus at this level.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: INTERACTIONS OF MATTER
C.IM.2: Gas laws
The kinetic-molecular theory can be used to explain the properties of gases (pressure, temperature and volume) through the motion and interactions of its
particles. Problems can also be solved involving the changes in temperature, pressure, volume and amount of a gas. When two of these four are kept constant,
the relationship between the other two can be quantified, described and explained using the kinetic-molecular theory. Real-world phenomena (e.g., why tire
pressure increases in hot weather, why a hot air balloon rises) can be explained using this theory. When solving gas problems, the Kelvin temperature scale must
be used since only in this scale is the temperature directly proportional to the average kinetic energy. The Kelvin temperature is based on a scale that has its
minimum temperature at absolute zero, a temperature at which all motion theoretically stops. Since equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure
contain an equal number of particles (Avogadro’s law), problems can be solved for an unchanging gaseous system using the ideal gas law (PV = nRT) where R is
the ideal gas constant (e.g., represented in multiple formats, 8.31 joules/(mole·K). The focus in this course is solving problems using the gas laws and
understanding their applications, rather than memorizing the specific names and formulas. Deviations from ideal gaseous behavior are reserved for more
advanced study. Relationships between the volume, temperature and pressure can be explored in the laboratory or through computer simulations or virtual
experiments.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

C.IM.3: Stoichiometry
A stoichiometric calculation involves the conversion from the amount of one substance in a chemical reaction to the amount of another substance. The coefficients
of the balanced equation indicate the ratios of the substances involved in the reaction in terms of both particles and moles.
Once the number of moles of a substance is known, amounts can be changed to mass, volume of a gas, volume of solutions and/or number of particles. Molarity is
a measure of the concentration of a solution that can be used in stoichiometric calculations. When performing a reaction in the lab, the experimental yield can be
compared to the theoretical yield to calculate percent yield. The concept of limiting reagents is treated conceptually. Mathematical applications can be utilized, but
it is important to address the symbolic representations as well. Molality and normality are concepts reserved for more advanced study.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

NATURE OF SCIENCE HIGH SCHOOL
  Nature of Science
  One goal of science education is to help students become scientifically literate citizens able to use science as a way of knowing about the natural and material
  world. All students should have sufficient understanding of scientific knowledge and scientific processes to enable them to distinguish what is science from what
  is not science and to make informed decisions about career choices, health maintenance, quality of life, community and other decisions that impact both
  themselves and others.

CONTENT ELABORATION: EARTH SYSTEMS: INTERCONNECTED SPHERES OF EARTH
This topic builds upon both the physical science and biology courses as they relate to energy transfer and transformation, conservation of energy and matter,
evolution, adaptation, biodiversity, population studies and ecosystem composition and dynamics. In grades 6-8, geologic processes, biogeochemical cycles,
climate, the composition and properties of the atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere (including the hydrologic cycle) are studied. In this course, the focus is on
the connections and interactions between Earth’s spheres (the hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere and lithosphere). Both natural and anthropogenic interactions
are studied. This includes an understanding of causes and effects of climate, global climate (including El Niño/La Niña patterns and trends) and changes in climate
through Earth’s history, geologic events (e.g., volcanic activity or mass wasting) that impact Earth’s spheres, biogeochemical cycles and patterns, the effect of
abiotic and biotic factors within an ecosystem, and the understanding that each of Earth’s spheres is part of the dynamic Earth system. Ground water and surface
water velocities and patterns are included as the movement of water (either at the surface, in the atmosphere or beneath the surface) can be a mode of
transmission of contamination. This builds upon previous hydrologic cycle studies in earlier grades. Geomorphology and topography are helpful in determining flow
patterns and pathways for contamination.
The connections and interactions of energy and matter between Earth’s spheres are researched and investigated using actual data. The emphasis is on the
interconnectedness of Earth’s spheres and the understanding of the complex relationships between them, including both abiotic and biotic factors. One event,
such as a petroleum release or a flood, can impact each sphere. Some impacts are long-term, others are short-term and most are a combination of both long- and
short-term. It is important to use real, quantifiable data to study the interactions, patterns and cycles among Earth’s spheres.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: EARTH’S RESOURCES
This topic explores the availability of Earth’s resources, extraction of the resources, contamination problems, remediation techniques and the storage/disposal of
the resources or by-products. Conservation, protection and sustainability of Earth’s resources are also included. This builds on energy and Earth’s resources
topics in grades 6-8 and chemistry and energy topics at the high school level.
To understand the effects that certain contaminants may have on the environment, scientific investigations and research should be conducted on a local, national
and global level. Water, air, land and biotic field and lab sampling/testing equipment and methods are utilized with real-world application. Quantifiable field and/or
lab data are used to analyze and draw conclusions regarding air, water or land quality. Examples of types of water-quality testing include: hydraulic conductivity,
suspended and dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, temperature, pH, fecal coliform and macro-invertebrate studies. Wetland or
woodland delineations and analysis, land use analysis and air monitoring (e.g., particulate matter sizes/amount) are all appropriate field study investigations.
Comparative analysis of scientific field or lab data should be used to quantify the environmental quality or conditions. Local data can also be compared to national
and international data.

OHIO’S LEARNING STANDARDS | SCIENCE | ADOPTED 2018                                                                                                             296
The study of relevant, local problems can be a way to connect the classroom to the real world. Within Ohio, there are numerous environmental topics that can be
investigated. Examples include wetland loss or mitigation, surface or ground water contamination (including sediment, chemical or thermal contamination),
watershed management, acid rain, septic system or sewage overflows/failures, landfill seepage, underground storage tank/pipe releases, deforestation, invasive
species, air pollution (e.g., photochemical smog or particulate matter), soil loss/erosion or acid mine drainage.
At the advanced science level, renewable and nonrenewable energy resources topics investigate the effectiveness, risk and efficiency for differing types of energy
resources at a local, state, national and global level. This builds upon grades 6-8 Earth and space science and physical science at the high school level. Nuclear
and geothermal energy are included in this topic.
Feasibility, availability, remediation and environmental cost are included in the extraction, storage, use and disposal of both abiotic and biotic resources.
Environmental impact is evaluated as it pertains to both environmental and human risks. Examples include chemical hazards, radiation, biological hazards,
toxicology and risk analysis studies. Learning about conservation and protection of the environment also requires an understanding of the existence and rationale
for laws and regulations to conserve resources and reduce and/or remediate contamination, but the emphasis should be on the science behind the laws and
regulations.
Relating Earth’s resources to a global scale and using technology to collect global resource data for comparative classroom study is recommended. In addition, it
is important to connect the industry and the scientific community to the classroom to increase the depth of understanding. Critical thinking and problem-solving
skills are important in evaluating resource use, management and conservation. New discoveries and research are important parts of this topic.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS AND ISSUES
This topic is a culminating section that incorporates the previous topics and applies them to a global or international scale. Case studies, developing and using
models, collecting and analyzing water and/or air quality data, conducting or researching population studies and methods of connecting to the real world is
emphasized for this topic. Technology can be used for comparative studies to share local data internationally so that specific quantifiable data can be compared
and used in understanding the impact of some of the environmental problems that exist on a global scale. Researching and investigating environmental factors on
a global level contributes to the depth of understanding by applying the environmental science concepts to problem solving and design. Examples of global topics
that can be explored include building water or air filtration models, investigating climate change data, monitoring endangered, introduced or invasive species and
studying the environmental effects of an increasing human population. Researching contemporary discoveries, new technology and new discoveries can lead to
improvement in environmental management.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

  Nature of Science
  One goal of science education is to help students become scientifically literate citizens able to use science as a way of knowing about the natural and material
  world. All students should have sufficient understanding of scientific knowledge and scientific processes to enable them to distinguish what is science from what
  is not science and to make informed decisions about career choices, health maintenance, quality of life, community and other decisions that impact both
  themselves and others.

CONTENT ELABORATION: MINERALS
This unit builds upon the Earth and Space Science strand in grade 6, where common minerals are defined, tested and classified. It also incorporates knowledge of
mineral properties and crystalline structures (chemical compositions and bonding) included in the chemistry sections of other high school courses.
The emphasis in this course is to relate the chemical and physical components of minerals to the properties of the minerals. This requires extensive mineral
testing, investigations, experimentation, observation, use of technology and models/modeling. The focus is on learning the ways to research, test and evaluate
minerals, not in memorization of mineral names or types.
Properties such as cleavage and hardness are connected to the chemical structure and bonding of the mineral. In addition, the environment in which minerals form
should be part of the classification of the mineral, using mineral data to help interpret the environmental conditions that existed during the formation of the mineral.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: IGNEOUS, METAMORPHIC AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS
This unit builds upon a variety of topics studied in middle school. In the Earth and Space Science strand, sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks are
introduced. Rocks and minerals are tested and classified. Plate tectonics, seismic waves and the structure of Earth are studied and the geologic record is
introduced (including the evidence of climatic variances through Earth’s history). In the Life Science strand, fossils and depositional environments are included as
they relate to the documented history of life in the geologic record. In the Physical Science strand, waves, thermal energy, currents, pressure and gravity are
presented.
In this course, geologic, topographic, seismic and aerial maps are used to locate and recognize igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary structures and features.
Technological advances permit the investigation of intrusive structures and the interior of Earth. Connections between the minerals present within each type of
rock and the environment formed are important. The processes and environmental conditions that lead to fossil fuel formation (Note: this links to the energy
resources section below) includes the fossil fuels found in Ohio, nationally and globally.

Bowen’s Reaction Series is used to develop an understanding of the relationship of cooling temperature, formation of specific igneous minerals and the resulting
igneous environment. The focus is on knowing how to use Bowen’s Reaction Series, not to memorize it. Virtual demonstrations and simulations of cooling magma
and crystallization of the igneous minerals found on the series can be helpful in conceptualizing the chart.
The magnetic properties of Earth are examined through the study of real data and evidence. The relationship of polar changes, magnetic striping, grid north, true
north and the North Pole are included in the study of Earth’s magnetic properties.
Features found in the ocean include all types of environments (igneous, metamorphic or sedimentary). Using models (3-D or virtual) with real-time data to simulate
waves, tides, currents, feature formation and changing sea levels to explore and investigate the ocean fully is recommended. Interpreting sections of the geologic
record to determine sea level changes and depositional environments, including relative age, is also recommended.
Technological advances can be used to observe and record the physical features of the Earth, including the ocean floor. Interpreting geologic history using maps
of local cross-sections of bedrock can be related to the geologic history of Ohio, the United States and Earth.

CONTENT ELABORATION: EARTH'S HISTORY
This unit builds upon a variety of topics studied in middle school. In the Earth and Space Science strand, sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks are
introduced. Rocks and minerals are tested and classified. Plate tectonics, seismic waves and the structure of Earth are studied and the geologic record is explored
(including uniformitarianism, superposition, cross-cutting relationships and the evidence of climatic variances through Earth’s history). In the Life Science strand,
fossils and depositional environments are included as they relate to the documented history of life in the geologic record. In the Physical Science strand,
radiometric dating, seismic waves, thermal energy, pressure and gravity are presented.
In this course, the long-term history of Earth and the analysis of the evidence from the geologic record (including fossil evidence) are investigated.
Using actual sections of the geologic record to interpret, compare and analyze can demonstrate the changes that have occurred in Ohio, in North America and
globally. The emphasis for this unit is to explore the geologic record and the immensity of the geologic record. The analysis of data and evidence found in the
variety of dating techniques (both absolute and relative), the complexity of the fossil record, and the impact that improving technology has had on the interpretation
and continued updating of what is known about the history of Earth are investigated. Geologic principles are essential in developing this level of knowledge. These
principles can be tested and experienced virtually, or through modeling, field studies, research and in-depth investigations.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: PLATE TECTONICS
This unit builds upon a variety of topics studied in middle school. In the Earth and Space Science strand, plate tectonics is studied in grade 8. Topics include plate
motion (evidence and causes, characteristics of oceanic and continental plates), seismic waves, continental drift, seafloor spreading, the structure of Earth’s
surface and interior (including specific layers) and paleomagnetism. In the Life Science strand, fossils and depositional environments are included. In the Physical
Science strand, density, convection, conductivity, motion, kinetic energy, radiometric dating, seismic waves, thermal energy, pressure and gravity are explored.
In this course, Earth’s interior and plate tectonics are investigated at greater depth using models, simulations, actual seismic data, real-time data, satellite data and
remote sensing. Relationships between energy, tectonic activity levels and earthquake or volcano predictions, and calculations to obtain the magnitude, focus and
epicenter of an earthquake are included. Evidence and data analysis are key in understanding this part of the Earth system. For example, GIS/GPS and/or satellite
data provide evidence for moving plates and changing landscapes (due to tectonic activity).
The causes for plate motion, the evidence of moving plates and the results of plate tectonics must be related to Earth’s past, present and future. The use of
evidence to support conclusions and predictions pertaining to plate motion is an important part of this unit.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.

VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: EARTH'S RESOURCES
This unit builds upon a variety of topics studied in previous courses. In elementary school, renewable/nonrenewable energy, soils, the atmosphere and water are
introduced. In middle school, Earth’s spheres, Earth’s resources and energy resources are explored. At the high school level, water, air, chemistry and energy
topics are studied. In this course, the Earth Resources topic should be looked at through the lens of geology when referring to renewable/non-renewable
resources, air, water, soil, and energy.
In this course, renewable and nonrenewable energy resources topics investigate the effectiveness and efficiency for differing types of energy resources at a local,
state, national and global level. Feasibility, availability and environmental cost are included in the extraction, storage, use and disposal of both abiotic and biotic
resources. Modeling (3-D or virtual), simulations and real-world data are used to investigate energy resources and exploration. The emphasis is on current, actual
data, contemporary science and technological advances in the field of energy resources.
Relating Earth’s resources (e.g., energy, air, water, soil) to a global scale and using technology to collect global resource data for comparative classroom study is
recommended. In addition, it is important to connect industry and the scientific community to the classroom to increase the depth of understanding. Critical thinking
and problem-solving skills are important in evaluating resource use and conservation.
Smaller scale investigations, such as a field study to monitor stream quality, construction mud issues, storm water management, nonpoint source contamination
problems (e.g., road-salt runoff, agricultural runoff, parking lot runoff) or thermal water contamination, can be useful in developing a deeper understanding of
Earth’s resources.
Earth systems are used to illustrate the interconnectedness of each of Earth’s spheres (hydrosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere and biosphere) and the relationship
between each type of Earth’s resources.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.

    • Glacial distribution and causes of glaciation
    • Types of glaciers – continental (ice sheets, ice caps), alpine/valley (piedmont, valley, cirque, ice caps)
    • Glacial structure, formation and movement
CONTENT ELABORATION: GLACIAL GEOLOGY
This unit builds upon a variety of topics previously studied. In fourth grade, Earth’s surface (landforms and features, including glacial geology) is introduced. In
middle school, igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, sediment and soils, the geologic record and Earth’s history are studied. The cryosphere and the
relationship of the analysis of ice cores in understanding changes in climate over thousands of years is also introduced. Fossils and fossil evidence within the
geologic record is found in the Life Science strand, building from second grade through high school biology.
An emphasis for this unit is tracing and tracking glacial history and present-day data for Ohio, the United States and globally. Scientific data found in the analysis of
the geologic record, ice cores and surficial geology should be used to provide the evidence for changes that have occurred over the history of Earth and are
observable in the present day. New discoveries, mapping projects, research, contemporary science and technological advances are included in the study of glacial
geology. The focus should be on the geologic processes and the criteria for movement. Modeling and simulations (3-D or virtual) can be used to illustrate glacial
movement and the resulting features.
Field investigations to map and document evidence of glaciers in the local area (if applicable) or virtual investigations can help demonstrate the resulting glacial
features and the impact that ice has had on the surface of Earth throughout history. Real-time data (using remote sensing, satellite, GPS/GIS, aerial
photographs/maps) can help support this topic.

P.M.1: Motion graphs
     • Position vs. time
     • Velocity vs. time
     • Acceleration vs. time
CONTENT ELABORATION: MOTION
In physical science, the concepts of position, displacement, velocity and acceleration were introduced and straight-line motion involving either uniform velocity or
uniform acceleration was investigated and represented in position vs. time graphs, velocity vs. time graphs, motion diagrams and data tables.
In this course, acceleration vs. time graphs are introduced and more complex graphs are considered that have both positive and negative displacement values and
involve motion that occurs in stages (e.g., an object accelerates then moves with constant velocity). Symbols representing acceleration are added to motion
diagrams and mathematical analysis of motion becomes increasingly more complex. Motion is explored through investigation and experimentation. Motion
detectors and computer graphing applications can be used to collect and organize data. Computer simulations and video analysis can be used to analyze motion
with greater precision.
P.M.1: Motion graphs
Instantaneous velocity for an accelerating object can be determined by calculating the slope of the tangent line for some specific instant on a position vs. time
graph. Instantaneous velocity will be the same as average velocity for conditions of constant velocity, but this is rarely the case for accelerating objects. The
position vs. time graph for objects increasing in speed will become steeper as they progress and the position vs. time graph for objects decreasing in speed will
become less steep.
On a velocity vs. time graph, objects increasing in speed will slope away from the x-axis and objects decreasing in speed will slope toward the x-axis. The slope of
a velocity vs. time graph indicates the acceleration so the graph will be a straight line (not necessarily horizontal) when the acceleration is constant. Acceleration is
positive for objects speeding up in a positive direction or objects slowing down in a negative direction. Acceleration is negative for objects slowing down in a
positive direction or speeding up in a negative direction. These are not concepts that should be memorized, but can be developed from analyzing the definition of
acceleration and the conditions under which acceleration would have these signs.
The word “deceleration” should not be used since it provides confusion between slowing down and negative acceleration. The area under the curve for a velocity
vs. time graph gives the change in position (displacement) but the absolute position cannot be determined from a velocity vs. time graph. Objects moving with
uniform acceleration will have a horizontal line on an acceleration vs. time graph. This line will be at the x-axis for objects that are either standing still or moving
with constant velocity. The area under the curve of an acceleration vs. time graph gives the change in velocity for the object, but the displacement, position and the
absolute velocity cannot be determined from an acceleration vs. time graph. The details about motion graphs should not be taught as rules to memorize, but rather
as generalizations that can be developed from interpreting the graphs.
P.M.2: Problem solving
Many problems can be solved from interpreting graphs and charts as detailed in the motion graphs section. In addition, when acceleration is constant, average
velocity can be calculated by taking the average of the initial and final instantaneous velocities (vavg = (vf − vi)/2). This relationship does not hold true when the
acceleration changes. The equation can be used in conjunction with other kinematic equations to solve increasingly complex problems, including those involving
free fall with negligible air resistance in which objects fall with uniform acceleration. Near the surface of Earth, in the absence of other forces, the acceleration of
freely falling objects is 9.81 m/s2. Assessments of motion problems, including projectile motion, will not include problems that require the quadratic equation to
solve.
                                                                                                                                                Back to Table of Contents

P.M.3: Projectile motion
When an object has both horizontal and vertical components of motion, as in a projectile, the components act independently of each other. For a projectile in the
absence of air resistance, this means that horizontally, the projectile will continue to travel at constant speed just like it would if there were no vertical motion.
Likewise, vertically the object will accelerate just as it would without any horizontal motion. Problem solving will be limited to solving for the range, time, initial
height, initial velocity or final velocity of horizontally launched projectiles with negligible air resistance. While it is not inappropriate to explore more complex
projectile problems, it must not be done at the expense of other parts of the curriculum.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: FORCES, MOMENTUM AND MOTION
In earlier grades, Newton’s laws of motion were introduced, gravitational forces and fields were described conceptually, the gravitational force (weight) acting on
objects near Earth’s surface was calculated, and friction forces and drag were addressed conceptually and quantified from force diagrams. The forces required for
circular motion were introduced conceptually. In this course, Newton’s laws of motion are applied to mathematically describe and predict the effects of forces on
more complex systems of objects and to analyze falling objects that experience significant air resistance.
Gravitational forces are studied as a universal phenomenon and gravitational field strength is quantified. Elastic forces and a more detailed look at friction are
included. At the atomic level, contact forces are actually due to the forces between the charged particles of the objects that appear to be touching. These electric
forces are responsible for friction forces, normal forces and other contact forces. Air resistance and drag are explained using the particle nature of matter.
Projectile motion is introduced and circular motion is quantified. The vector properties of momentum and impulse are introduced and used to analyze elastic and
inelastic collisions between objects. Analysis of experimental data collected in laboratory investigations is used to study forces and momentum. This can include
the use of force probes and computer software to collect and analyze data.
P.F.1: Newton’s laws applied to complex problems
Newton’s laws of motion, especially the third law, can be used to solve complex problems that involve systems of many objects that move together as one (e.g., an
Atwood machine). The equation a = Fnet/m that was introduced in physical science can be used to solve more complex problems involving systems of objects and
situations involving forces that must themselves be quantified (e.g., gravitational forces, elastic forces, friction forces).
P.F.2: Gravitational force and fields
Gravitational interactions are very weak compared to other interactions and are difficult to observe unless one of the objects is extremely massive (e.g., the sun,
planets, moons). The force law for gravitational interaction states that the strength of the gravitational force is proportional to the product of the two masses and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the centers of the masses, Fg = (G·m1 ·m2)/r2. The proportionality constant, G, is called the universal
gravitational constant and has a value of 6.674·10-11 m3/(kg·s2). Problem solving may involve calculating the net force for an object between two massive objects
(e.g., Earth-moon system, planet-sun system) or calculating the position of such an object given the net force.
The strength of an object’s (i.e., the source’s) gravitational field at a certain location, g, is given by the gravitational force per unit of mass experienced by another
object placed at that location, g = Fg/m. Comparing this equation to Newton’s second law can be used to explain why all objects on Earth’s surface accelerate at
the same rate in the absence of air resistance. While the gravitational force from another object can be used to determine the field strength at a particular location,
the field of the object is always there, even if the object is not interacting with anything else. The field direction is toward the center of the source. Given the
gravitational field strength at a certain location, the gravitational force between the source of that field and any object at that location can be calculated. Greater
                                                                                                                                                 Back to Table of Contents

gravitational field strengths result in larger gravitational forces on masses placed in the field. Gravitational fields can be represented by field diagrams obtained by
plotting field arrows at a series of locations. Field line diagrams are excluded from this course. Distinctions between gravitational and inertial masses are excluded.
A scale indicates weight by measuring the normal force between the object and the surface supporting it. The reading on the scale accurately measures the weight
if the system is not accelerating. However, if the scale is used in an accelerating system, as in an elevator, the reading on the scale does not equal the actual
weight. The scale reading can be referred to as the “apparent weight.” This apparent weight in accelerating elevators can be explained and calculated using force
diagrams and Newton’s laws.
P.F.3: Elastic forces
Elastic materials stretch or compress in proportion to the load they support. The mathematical model for the force that a linearly elastic object exerts on another
object is Felastic = kΔx, where Δx is the displacement of the object from its relaxed position. The direction of the elastic force is always toward the relaxed position of
the elastic object. The constant of proportionality, k, is the same for compression and extension and depends on the “stiffness” of the elastic object.
P.F.4: Friction force (static and kinetic)
The amount of kinetic friction between two objects depends on the electric forces between the atoms of the two surfaces sliding past each other. It also depends
upon the magnitude of the normal force that pushes the two surfaces together. This can be represented mathematically as Fk = μkFN, where μk is the coefficient of
kinetic friction that depends upon the materials of which the two surfaces are made.
Sometimes friction forces can prevent objects from sliding past each other, even when an external force is applied parallel to the two surfaces that are in contact.
This is called static friction, which is mathematically represented by Fs ≤ μsFN. The maximum amount of static friction possible depends on the types of materials
that make up the two surfaces and the magnitude of the normal force pushing the objects together, Fsmax = μsFN. As long as the external net force is less than or
equal to the maximum force of static friction, the objects will not move relative to one another. In this case, the actual static friction force acting on the object will be
equal to the net external force acting on the object, but in the opposite direction. If the external net force exceeds the maximum static friction force for the object,
the objects will move relative to each other and the friction between them will no longer be static friction, but will be kinetic friction.
P.F.5: Air resistance and drag
Liquids have more drag than gases. When an object pushes on the particles in a fluid, the fluid particles can push back on the object according to Newton’s third
law and cause a change in motion of the object. This is how helicopters experience lift and how swimmers propel themselves forward. Forces from fluids are
quantified using Newton’s second law and force diagrams. Factors that affect air resistance and drag and the determination of terminal velocity may be included.
P.F.6: Forces in two dimensions
     • Adding vector forces
     • Motion down inclines
     • Centripetal forces and circular motion
Net forces will be calculated for force vectors with directions between 0° and 360° or a certain angle from a reference (e.g., 37° above the horizontal). Vector
addition can be done with trigonometry or by drawing scaled diagrams. Problems can be solved for objects sliding down inclines. The net force, final velocity, time,
displacement and acceleration can be calculated. Inclines will either be frictionless or the force of friction will already be quantified. Calculations of friction forces
down inclines from the coefficients of friction and the normal force will not be addressed in this course.
An object moves at constant speed in a circular path when there is a constant net force that is always directed at right angles to the direction of motion toward the
center of the circle. In this case, the net force causes an acceleration that shows up as a change in direction. If the force is removed, the object will continue in a
straight-line path. The nearly circular orbits of planets and satellites result from the force of gravity. Centripetal acceleration is directed toward the center of the
circle and can be calculated by the equation ac = v2/r, where v is the speed of the object and r is the radius of the circle. This expression for acceleration can be
substituted into Newton’s second law to calculate the centripetal force. Since the centripetal force is a net force, it can be equated to friction (unbanked curves),
gravity, elastic force, etc., to perform more complex calculations.

P.F.7: Momentum, impulse and conservation of momentum
Momentum, p, is a vector quantity that is directly proportional to the mass, m, and the velocity, v, of the object. Momentum is in the same direction the object is
moving and can be mathematically represented by the equation p = mv. The conservation of linear momentum states that the total (net) momentum before an
interaction in a closed system is equal to the total momentum after the interaction. In a closed system, linear momentum is always conserved for elastic, inelastic
and totally inelastic collisions. While total energy is conserved for any collision, in an elastic collision, the kinetic energy also is conserved. Given the initial motions
of two objects, qualitative predictions about the change in motion of the objects due to a collision can be made. Problems can be solved for the initial or final
velocities of objects involved in inelastic and totally inelastic collisions. Momentum may be dealt with in two dimensions conceptually, but at this level calculations
should be limited to only one dimension. Coefficients of restitution are beyond the scope of this course.
Impulse, Δp, is the total momentum transfer into or out of a system. Any momentum transfer is the result of interactions with objects outside the system and is
directly proportional to both the average net external force acting on the system, Favg, and the time interval of the interaction, t. It can mathematically be
represented by Δp = pf – pi = Favg Δt. This equation can be used to justify why momentum changes due to the external force of friction can be ignored when the
time of interaction is extremely short. Average force, initial or final velocity, mass or time interval can be calculated in multi-step word problems. For objects that
experience a given impulse (e.g., a truck coming to a stop), a variety of force/time combinations are possible. The time could be small, which would require a large
force (e.g., the truck crashing into a brick wall to a sudden stop). Conversely, the time could be extended which would result in a much smaller force (e.g., the truck
applying the brakes for a long period of time).
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: ENERGY
In Physical Science, the role of strong nuclear forces in radioactive decay, half-lives, fission and fusion, and mathematical problem solving involving kinetic energy,
gravitational potential energy, energy conservation and work (when the force and displacement were in the same direction) were introduced. In this course, the
concept of gravitational potential energy is understood from the perspective of a field, elastic potential energy is introduced and quantified, nuclear processes are
explored further, and the concept of mass-energy equivalence is introduced. The concept of work is expanded, power is introduced and the principle of
conservation of energy is applied to increasingly complex situations. Energy is explored by analyzing data gathered in scientific investigations. Computers and
probes can be used to collect and analyze data.
P.E.1: Gravitational potential energy
When two attracting masses interact, the kinetic energies of both objects change but neither is acting as the energy source or the receiver. Instead, the energy is
transferred into or out of the gravitational field around the system as gravitational potential energy. A single mass does not have gravitational potential energy.
Only the system of attracting masses can have gravitational potential energy. When two masses are moved farther apart, energy is transferred into the field as
gravitational potential energy. When two masses are moved closer together, gravitational potential energy is transferred out of the field.
P.E.2: Energy in springs
The approximation for the change in the potential elastic energy of an elastic object (e.g., a spring) is ΔEelastic = ½ k Δx2 where Δx is the distance the elastic object
is stretched or compressed from its relaxed length.
P.E.3: Work and power
Work can be calculated for situations in which the force and the displacement are at angles to one another using the equation W = FΔx(cosθ) where W is the work,
F is the force, Δx is the displacement, and θ is the angle between the force and the displacement. This means when the force and the displacement are at right
angles, no work is done and no energy is transferred between the objects. Such is the case for circular motion.
The rate of energy change or transfer is called power (P) and can be mathematically represented by P = ΔE/Δt or P = W/Δt. Power is a scalar property. The unit of
power is the watt (W), which is equivalent to one joule of energy transferred in one second (J/s).
P.E.4: Conservation of energy
The total initial energy of the system and the energy entering the system are equal to the total final energy of the system and the energy leaving the system.
Although the various forms of energy appear very different, each can be measured in a way that makes it possible to keep track of how much of one form is
converted into another. Situations involving energy transformations can be represented with verbal or written descriptions, energy diagrams and mathematical
equations. Translations can be made between these representations.
The conservation of energy principle applies to any defined system and time interval within a situation or event in which there are no nuclear changes that involve
mass-energy equivalency. The system and time interval may be defined to focus on one particular aspect of the event. The defined system and time interval may
then be changed to obtain information about different aspects of the same event.

P.E.5: Nuclear energy
Alpha, beta, gamma and positron emission each have different properties and result in different changes to the nucleus. The identity of new elements can be
predicted for radioisotopes that undergo alpha or beta decay. Nuclear reactions, such as fission and fusion, are accompanied by large energy changes that are
much greater than those that accompany chemical reactions. Nuclear fission reactions are used as a controlled source of energy in nuclear power plants. There
are advantages and disadvantages of generating electricity from fission and fusion. During nuclear interactions, the transfer of energy out of a system is directly
proportional to the change in mass of the system as expressed by E = mc2, which is known as the equation for mass-energy equivalence. A very small loss in
mass is accompanied by a release of a large amount of energy. In nuclear processes such as nuclear decay, fission and fusion, the mass of the product is less
than the mass of the original nuclei. The missing mass appears as energy. This energy can be calculated for fission and fusion when given the masses of the
particle(s) formed and the masses of the particle(s) that interacted to produce them.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: WAVES
In earlier grades, the electromagnetic spectrum and basic properties (wavelength, frequency, amplitude) and behaviors of waves (absorption, reflection,
transmission, refraction, interference, diffraction) were introduced. In this course, conservation of energy is applied to waves and the measurable properties of
waves (wavelength, frequency, amplitude) are used to mathematically describe the behavior of waves (index of refraction, law of reflection, single- and double-slit
diffraction). The wavelet model of wave propagation and interactions is not addressed in this course. Waves are explored experimentally in the laboratory. This
may include, but is not limited to, water waves, waves in springs, the interaction of light with mirrors, lenses, barriers with one or two slits and diffraction gratings.
P.W.1: Wave properties
When a wave reaches a barrier or a new medium, a portion of its energy is reflected at the boundary and a portion of the energy passes into the new medium.
Some of the energy that passes to the new medium may be absorbed by the medium and transformed to other forms of energy, usually thermal energy, and some
continues as a wave in the new medium. Some of the energy may also be dissipated and no longer be part of the wave since it has been transformed into thermal
energy or transferred out of the system due to the interaction of the system with surrounding objects. Usually all of these processes occur simultaneously, but the
total amount of energy must remain constant.
When waves bounce off barriers (reflection), the angle at which a wave approaches the barrier (angle of incidence) equals the angle at which the wave reflects off
the barrier (angle of reflection). When a wave travels from a two-dimensional (e.g., surface water, seismic waves) or three-dimensional (e.g., sound,
electromagnetic waves) medium into another medium in which the wave travels at a different speed, both the speed and the wavelength of the transferred wave
change. Depending on the angle between the wave and the boundary, the direction of the wave can also change, resulting in refraction. The amount of bending of
waves around barriers or small openings (diffraction) increases with decreasing wavelength. When the wavelength is smaller than the obstacle or opening, no
noticeable diffraction occurs. Standing waves and interference patterns between two sources are included in this topic. As waves pass through a single or double
slit, diffraction patterns are created with alternating lines of constructive and destructive interference. The diffraction patterns demonstrate predictable changes as
the width of the slit(s), spacing between the slits and/or the wavelength of waves passing through the slits changes.
P.W.2: Light phenomena
The path of light waves can be represented with ray diagrams to show reflection and refraction through converging lenses, diverging lenses and plane mirrors.
Since light is a wave, the law of reflection applies. Snell’s law, n1sinθ1 = n2sinθ2, quantifies refraction in which n is the index of refraction of the medium and θ is the
angle the wave enters or leaves the medium as measured from the normal line. The index of refraction of a material can be calculated by the equation n = c/v,
                                                                                                                                                 Back to Table of Contents


OHIO’S LEARNING STANDARDS | SCIENCE | ADOPTED 2018                                                                                                                   350
where n is the index of refraction of a material, v is the speed of light through the material, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Diffraction patterns of light are
addressed, including patterns from diffraction gratings.
There are two models of how radiant energy travels through space at the speed of light. One model is that the radiation travels in discrete packets of energy called
photons that are continuously emitted from an object in all directions. The energy of these photons is directly proportional to the frequency of the electromagnetic
radiation. This particle-like model is called the photon model of light energy transfer. A second model is that radiant energy travels like a wave that spreads out in
all directions from a source. This wave-like model is called the electromagnetic wave model of light energy transfer. Strong scientific evidence supports both the
particle-like model and wave-like model. Depending on the problem scientists are trying to solve, either the particle-like model or the wave-like model of radiant
energy transfer is used. Students are not required to know the details of the evidence that supports either model at this level.
Humans can only perceive a very narrow portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Radiant energy from the sun or a light bulb filament is a mixture of all the colors
of light (visible light spectrum). The different colors correspond to different radiant energies. When white light hits an object, the pigments in the object reflect one
or more colors in all directions and absorb the other colors.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is

CONTENT ELABORATION: ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
In earlier grades, electric and magnetic potential energy were treated conceptually. The relative number of subatomic particles present in charged and neutral
objects, attraction and repulsion between electrical charges and attraction and repulsion between magnetic poles were explored. The concept of fields to
conceptually explain forces at a distance was introduced and the concepts of current, potential difference (voltage) and resistance were used to explain circuits.
Additionally, connections between electricity and magnetism were made as observed in electromagnets, motors and generators. In this course, the details of
electrical and magnetic forces and energy are further explored and can be used as additional examples of energy and forces affecting motion.
P.EM.1: Charging objects (friction, contact and induction)
For all methods of charging neutral objects, one object/system ends up with a surplus of positive charge and the other object/system ends up with the same
amount of surplus of negative charge. This supports the law of conservation of charge that states that charges cannot be created or destroyed. Tracing the
movement of electrons for each step in different ways of charging objects (rubbing together two neutral materials to charge by friction; charging by contact and by
induction) can explain the differences between them. When an electrical conductor is charged, the charge “spreads out” over the surface. When an electrical
insulator is charged, the excess or deficit of electrons on the surface is localized to a small area of the insulator.
There can be electrical interactions between charged and neutral objects. Metal conductors have a lattice of fixed positively charged metal ions surrounded by a
“sea” of negatively charged electrons that flow freely within the lattice. If the neutral object is a metal conductor, the free electrons in the metal are attracted toward
or repelled away from the charged object. As a result, one side of the conductor has an excess of electrons and the opposite side has an electron deficit. This
separation of charges on the neutral conductor can result in a net attractive force between the neutral conductor and the charged object. When a charged object is
near a neutral insulator, the electron cloud of each insulator atom shifts position slightly so it is no longer centered on the nucleus. The separation of charge is very
small, much less than the diameter of the atom. Still, this small separation of charges for billions of neutral insulator particles can result in a net attractive force
between the neutral insulator and the charged object.
P.EM.2: Coulomb’s law
Two charged objects, which are small compared to the distance between them, can be modeled as point charges. The forces between point charges are
proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the point charges [Fe = (ke q1 q2)/r2]. Problems may be
solved for the electric force, the amount of charge on one of the two objects or the distance between the two objects. Problems may also be solved for three- or
four-point charges in a line if the vector sum of the forces is zero. This can be explored experimentally through computer simulations. Electric forces acting within
and between atoms are vastly stronger than the gravitational forces acting between the atoms. However, gravitational forces are only attractive and can
accumulate in massive objects to produce a large and noticeable effect. Conversely, electric forces are both attractive and repulsive and tend to cancel each other
out.

OHIO’S LEARNING STANDARDS | SCIENCE | ADOPTED 2018                                                                                                                        353
P.EM.3: Electric fields and electric potential energy
The strength of the electrical field of a charged object at a certain location is given by the electric force per unit charge experienced by another charged object
placed at that location, E = Fe/q. This equation can be used to calculate the electric field strength, the electric force or the electric charge. However, the electric
field is always there, even if the object is not interacting with anything else. The direction of the electric field at a certain location is parallel to the direction of the
electrical force on a positively charged object at that location. The electric field caused by a collection of charges is equal to the vector sum of the electric fields
caused by the individual charges (superposition of charge). This topic can be explored experimentally through computer simulations. Greater electric field
strengths result in larger electric forces on electrically charged objects placed in the field. Electric fields can be represented by field diagrams obtained by plotting
field arrows at a series of locations. Electric field diagrams for a dipole, two-point charges (both positive, both negative, one positive and one negative) and parallel
capacitor plates are included. Field line diagrams are excluded from this course.
The concept of electric potential energy can be understood from the perspective of an electric field. When two attracting or repelling charges interact, the kinetic
energies of both objects change but neither is acting as the energy source or the receiver. Instead, the energy is transferred into or out of the electric field around
the system as electric potential energy. A single charge does not have electric potential energy. Only the system of attracting or repelling charges can have electric
potential energy. When the distance between the attracting or repelling charges changes, there is a change in the electric potential energy of the system. When
two opposite charges are moved farther apart or two like charges are moved close together, energy is transferred into the field as electric potential energy. When
two opposite charges are moved closer together or two like charges are moved farther apart, electric potential energy is transferred out of the field. When a charge
is transferred from one object to another, work is required to separate the positive and negative charges. If there is no change in kinetic energy and no energy is
transferred out of the system, the work increases the electric potential energy of the system.
P.EM.4: DC circuits
Once a circuit is switched on, the current and potential difference are experienced almost instantaneously in all parts of the circuit even though the electrons are
only moving at speeds of a few centimeters per hour in a current-carrying wire. It is the electric field that travels instantaneously through all parts of the circuit,
moving the electrons that are already present in the wire. Since electrical charge is conserved, in a closed system such as a circuit, the current flowing into a
branch point junction must equal the total current flowing out of the junction (junction rule).
Resistance is measured in ohms and has different cumulative effects when added to series and parallel circuits. The potential difference, or voltage (ΔV), across
an energy source is the potential energy difference (ΔE) supplied by the energy source per unit charge (q) (ΔV = ΔE/q). The electric potential difference across a
resistor is the product of the current and the resistance (ΔV = I R). In this course, only ohmic resistors will be studied. When potential difference vs. current is
plotted for an ohmic resistor, the graph will be a straight line and the value of the slope will be the resistance. Since energy is conserved for any closed loop, the
energy put into the system by the battery must equal the energy that is transformed by the resistors. For circuits with resistors in series, this means that Vbattery =
ΔV1 + ΔV2 + ΔV3 +…. The rate of energy transfer (power) across each resistor is equal to the product of the current through and the voltage drop across each
resistor (P = ΔV I) and Pbattery = I ΔV1 + I ΔV2 + I ΔV3 +… = IΔVbattery. Equations should be understood conceptually and used to calculate the current or potential
difference at different locations of a parallel, series or mixed circuit. However, the names of the laws (e.g., Ohm’s law,) are not the focus. Opportunities for
measuring and analyzing current, voltage and resistance in parallel, series and mixed circuits should be provided. This can be done with traditional laboratory
equipment and through computer simulations.

P.EM.5: Magnetic fields
The direction of the magnetic field at any point in space is the equilibrium direction of the north end of a compass placed at that point. Magnetic fields can be
represented by field diagrams obtained by plotting field arrows at a series of locations. Field line diagrams are excluded from this course. Calculations for the
magnetic field strength are not required at this grade level, but it is important to note that greater magnetic fields result in larger magnetic forces on magnetic
objects or moving charges placed in the field. In this course, the concept of magnetic fields will not be addressed mathematically.
P.EM.6: Electromagnetic interactions
Magnetic forces are very closely related to electric forces. Even though they appear to be distinct from each other, they are thought of as different aspects of a
single electromagnetic force. A flow of charged particles (including an electric current) creates a magnetic field around the moving particles or the current carrying
wire. Motion in a nearby magnet is evidence of this field. Electric currents in Earth’s interior give Earth an extensive magnetic field, which is detected from the
orientation of compass needles. The motion of electrically charged particles in atoms produces magnetic fields. Usually these magnetic fields in an atom are
randomly oriented and therefore cancel each other out. In magnetic materials, the subatomic magnetic fields are aligned, resulting in a macroscopic magnetic field.
A moving charged particle interacts with a magnetic field. The magnetic force that acts on a moving charged particle in a magnetic field is perpendicular to both the
magnetic field and to the direction of motion of the charged particle. The magnitude of the magnetic force depends on the speed of the moving particle, the
magnitude of the charge of the particle, the strength of the magnetic field, and the angle between the velocity and the magnetic field. There is no magnetic force on
a particle moving parallel to the magnetic field. Calculations of the magnetic force acting on moving particles are not required at this grade level. Moving charged
particles in magnetic fields typically follow spiral trajectories since the force is perpendicular to the motion.
A changing magnetic field creates an electric field. If a closed conducting path, such as a wire, is in the vicinity of a changing magnetic field, a current may flow
through the wire. A changing magnetic field can be created in a closed loop of wire if the magnet and the wire move relative to one another. This can cause a
current to be induced in the wire. The strength of the current depends upon the strength of the magnetic field, the velocity of the relative motion and the number of
loops in the wire. Calculations for current induced in a wire or coil of wire is not required at this level. A changing electric field creates a magnetic field and a
changing magnetic field creates an electric field. Thus, radiant energy travels in electromagnetic waves produced by changing the motion of charges or by
changing magnetic fields. Therefore, electromagnetic radiation is a pattern of changing electric and magnetic fields that travel at the speed of light.
The interplay of electric and magnetic forces is the basis for many modern technologies that convert mechanical energy to electrical energy (generators) or
electrical energy to mechanical energy (electric motors) as well as devices that produce or receive electromagnetic waves. Therefore, coils of wire and magnets
are found in many electronic devices including speakers, microphones, generators and electric motors. The interactions between electricity and magnetism should
be explored in the laboratory setting. Experiments with the inner workings of motors, generators and electromagnets can be conducted. Current technologies using
these principles can be explored.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

NATURE OF SCIENCE HIGH SCHOOL
  Nature of Science
  One goal of science education is to help students become scientifically literate citizens able to use science as a way of knowing about the natural and material
  world. All students should have sufficient understanding of scientific knowledge and scientific processes to enable them to distinguish what is science from what
  is not science and to make informed decisions about career choices, health maintenance, quality of life, community and other decisions that impact both
  themselves and others.

CONTENT ELABORATION: LEVELS OF ORGANIZATION
AP.LO.1: Hierarchy of organization
Building on knowledge about cell structures and processes from middle school and Biology, this topic focuses on the increasing complexity of cells as they are
organized into tissues. Several tissue types make up an organ. Several organs working together make up an organ system. All the organ systems interact and
form the human body.
AP.LO.2: Types of tissues
The human body is comprised of four types of tissues: epithelial, connective, muscle and nervous. This topic includes a broad overview of the structure, function
and location of each tissue type. Tissues can be studied as an independent unit or as they are encountered within each organ system. Investigations are used to
understand and explain types of tissues in a variety of inquiry and design scenarios that can incorporate evolutionary concepts, scientific reasoning, comparative
analysis, communication skills and real-world applications.
AP.LO.3: Homeostasis
Homeostasis is a theme that is explored throughout the course. Homeostasis involves positive and negative feedback mechanisms that continuously monitor and
adjust the body's internal conditions (e.g., temperature regulation, pH, hormone regulation, blood pressure, hemostasis). At times, there can be a disruption (or
disruptions) in the feedback loops, creating an imbalance. This homeostatic imbalance can result in a variety of conditions.
AP.LO.4: Anatomical terminology
Standard anatomical position is to be used as a reference point. Each area of the human body is identified by region. The features and structures of the body,
relative to each other, are described by directional terms. The body and its organs can be divided by planes. The organs are located in cavities.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: SUPPORT AND MOTION
AP.SM.1: Integumentary system
The integumentary system consists of skin and accessory structures. The skin is composed of three layers: the epidermis, the dermis and the hypodermis
(subcutaneous layer). The accessory structures can include sweat glands, sebaceous glands, arrector pili muscles, hair follicles and nails. Skin functions include
protection, temperature regulation, excretion and sensory perception. These occur through the processes of perspiration, skin production and shedding, vitamin D
synthesis and repair. Homeostatic imbalances are explored. These include, but are not limited to, burns, skin cancer, anhidrosis, acne, eczema or scleroderma.
Investigations are used to understand and explain the integumentary system in a variety of inquiry and design scenarios that can incorporate evolutionary
concepts, scientific reasoning, comparative analysis, communication skills and real-world applications.
AP.SM.2: Skeletal system
The skeletal system is composed of bones, cartilage, joints and ligaments. Bones make up most of the skeleton. There are four main cell types that compose bone
tissue, each with a specific function: osteogenic cells, osteocytes, osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The microscopic anatomy of compact bone includes osteons.
Bones are classified by their shape. The structure of a typical long bone can be explored. Specific bones of the skeleton can be studied by their subdivisions: the
axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. Cartilage is found in areas of the nose, ears, ribs and joints. Joints can be classified by structure or by function. The
general structure of synovial joints may be explored. Ligaments connect bone to bone, stabilizing joints.
The skeletal system provides support for the human body, protects soft organs, allows for movement due to attachment of muscles, stores minerals and fat and
forms blood cells. Processes of the skeletal system include hematopoiesis, ossification and bone growth and remodeling. A comparison of male to female, juvenile
to adult or human to other vertebrate skeletons may be explored. Homeostatic imbalances are explored. These include, but are not limited to, osteoporosis,
malnutrition, fractures, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries and arthritis. Investigations are used to understand and explain the skeletal system in a variety of
inquiry and design scenarios that can incorporate evolutionary concepts, scientific reasoning, comparative analysis, communication skills and real-world
applications.
AP.SM.3: Muscular system
The muscular system consists of three types of muscle cells: skeletal, smooth and cardiac. The primary function of the muscular system is to contract, thereby,
moving the body and internal fluids, maintaining posture, generating heat and stabilizing joints. Muscles are controlled voluntarily and/or involuntarily.
Heart muscle cells are mononucleated, branched and striated. Intercalated disks are characteristic of cardiac muscle and aid in communication between cardiac
muscle cells. Smooth muscle cells, found in the hollow organs and blood vessels, are mononucleated, spindle-shaped and nonstriated. Skeletal muscle cells,
found attached to bones and skin, are multinucleated, cylindrical and striated. The muscles of the body can be studied by group, which include the muscles of the
head, face and neck, the trunk and the upper and lower limbs.

OHIO’S LEARNING STANDARDS | Science | ADOPTED 2018
Processes of the muscular system include gross body movements produced by skeletal muscles as they interact with the skeletal system, and muscle contraction.
The connection between the nervous system and the skeletal system should be explored through the study of action potentials and the resulting contraction of
sarcomeres, as described by the sliding filament theory. Energy processing and muscle responses to stimuli can be studied along with building muscle tissue
through exercise. The effects of steroids can also be investigated. Homeostatic imbalances are explored. These include, but are not limited to, muscular dystrophy
and atrophy. Investigations are used to understand and explain the muscular system in a variety of inquiry and design scenarios that can incorporate evolutionary
concepts, scientific reasoning, comparative analysis, communication skills and real-world applications.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: INTEGRATION AND COORDINATION
AP.IC.1: Nervous system
The nervous system consists of neurons and supporting cells that combine to form nerves, the spinal cord and the brain. The primary functions of the nervous
system are sensation, integration and response. A comparison of the structures and functions of the central and peripheral nervous systems should be explored.
The central nervous system is composed of the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system includes the remaining nervous tissue.
A neuron consists of dendrites, a cell body and an axon. Neurons conduct electrical impulses along their membranes and at synapses. Brain cells can detect and
sometimes respond to these impulses. Neuroglial cells help to support neural function.
The brain consists of three major parts: the cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem. The cerebrum is divided into lobes and hemispheres. Functions of the cerebrum
that may be explored include voluntary muscle control, memory, sensory perception, emotions and speech. The cerebellum is primarily responsible for balance
and coordination. The brainstem, a part of the autonomic nervous system, includes structural divisions that perform basic life functions such as breathing and heart
rate.
The spinal cord is a continuation of the brainstem. The spinal cord is a bundle of nerve tracts that transmits nerve signals between the brain and the body through
electrical impulses.
Nerves are bundles of neurons that transmit impulses between the peripheral and central nervous systems. The study of nerves can include sciatic, cranial and
spinal nerves. Supporting structures of the central nervous system include the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid which protect the central nervous system.
Processes of the nervous system are action potential propagation, simple nerve pathways (reflex arc) and neurotransmitter function. Homeostatic imbalances are
explored. These include, but are not limited to, the effects of drugs, mental illnesses, spinal injuries, concussions, meningitis and multiple sclerosis (MS).
Investigations are used to understand and explain the nervous system in a variety of inquiry and design scenarios that can incorporate evolutionary concepts,
scientific reasoning, comparative analysis, communication skills and real-world applications.

AP.IC.2: Special senses
     • Sense of sight
     • Senses of hearing and balance
     • Senses of taste and smell
The special senses consist of sight, hearing, balance, smell and taste. Each sense involves a network of feedback processes and consists of distinct structures.
Sense of sight
The eye provides visual environmental feedback and includes primary and accessory structures. Light enters through the pupil and is then focused by the lens
onto the retina at the visual axis. The optic nerve transmits the electrical impulses to the brain where they are translated. The accessory structures provide
lubrication, protection and support to the eye.
Processes include stimulation of the photoreceptors (rods and cones) by light. Homeostatic imbalances are explored. These include, but are not limited to, certain
types of blindness, conjunctivitis, glaucoma, astigmatism, hyperopia, myopia and cataracts. Investigations are used to understand and explain the sense of sight in
a variety of inquiry and design scenarios that can incorporate evolutionary concepts, scientific reasoning, comparative analysis (e.g., squid, falcon, hawks)
communication skills and real-world applications.
Senses of hearing and balance
The ears respond to a range of sounds and provide a sense of equilibrium. The structures include those of the outer, middle and inner ear. Processes of hearing
and balance should be explored including the perception of sound and spatial awareness. Homeostatic imbalances are explored. These include, but are not limited
to, certain types of hearing loss, otitis media, lack of balance (e.g., vertigo), tinnitus, auditory processing, motion sickness and Meniere’s syndrome. Investigations
are used to understand and explain the senses of hearing and balance in a variety of inquiry and design scenarios that can incorporate evolutionary concepts,
scientific reasoning, comparative analysis, communication skills and real-world applications.
Senses of taste and smell
The senses of taste and smell occur primarily in the oral and nasal cavities. The structure of taste buds and olfactory cells are the foundation of taste and smell.
The location, structure and afferent pathways of taste and smell receptors should be addressed.
Processes include activation of chemoreceptors and transmission of electrical impulses to the brain, where they are integrated. Homeostatic imbalances are
explored. These include, but are not limited to, age-related sensitivities, taste preferences, anosmia and olfactory auras. Investigations are used to understand and
explain the senses of taste and smell in a variety of inquiry and design scenarios that can incorporate evolutionary concepts, scientific reasoning, comparative
analysis, communication skills and real-world applications.
AP.IC.3: Endocrine system
The endocrine system is comprised of glands that secrete hormones resulting in a response in target cells or organs. Glands with their associated hormones may
include pituitary, hypothalamus, thyroid, thymus, parathyroid, pineal, pancreas, adrenal, ovaries and testes. The endocrine system results in regulating
metabolism, maintaining homeostasis, regulating growth and development, and controlling reproduction through hormonal release.
The processes involved in the endocrine system should include a comparison of negative and positive feedback systems. Negative feedback examples can
include regulation of blood glucose levels, calcium levels, blood pressure and temperature. Positive feedback examples can include oxytocin in childbirth and
hemostasis.
Homeostatic imbalances are explored. These include, but are not limited to, hyper- and hypo- functions of glands, diabetes (type I and type II), gigantism and
dwarfism. Investigations are used to understand and explain the endocrine system in a variety of inquiry and design scenarios that can incorporate evolutionary
concepts, scientific reasoning, comparative analysis, communication skills and real-world applications.

EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: TRANSPORT
AP.T.1: Blood
Blood is composed of plasma and the formed elements: red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). The primary
functions of blood are transportation, protection and regulation. Plasma, the most abundant component of blood, is the liquid portion that transports dissolved
nutrients, waste, hormones, antibodies and proteins throughout the body. Red blood cells carry oxygen used during cellular processes throughout the body. White
blood cells identify and protect the body against infectious disease and foreign cells. Platelets bind together when a blood vessel is damaged resulting in blood clot
formation.
The major ABO blood types, A, B, AB and O, are determined by the presence or absence of antigens on the surface of red blood cells. An additional antigen is
present or absent on the surface of red blood cells determining Rh factor. Blood type antibodies are found in plasma. Processes related to blood include the
production of blood cells and platelets, and hemostasis. Homeostatic imbalances are explored. These include, but are not limited to, sickle cell anemia,
hemophilia, deep vein thrombosis, leukemia and lymphoma. Investigations are used to understand and explain blood in a variety of inquiry and design scenarios
that can incorporate evolutionary concepts, scientific reasoning, comparative analysis, communication skills and real-world applications.
AP.T.2: Cardiovascular system
The cardiovascular system consists of the heart and blood vessels. The heart is mostly comprised of cardiac muscle which is supplied with oxygenated blood by
coronary arteries.
The structure of the heart includes four chambers, four valves and major vessels leading to and from the heart. The flow of blood through the heart, pulmonary and
systemic circuits should be explored. Blood flows from arteries, to arterioles, to capillaries, to venules, then to veins. In the capillaries, oxygen, nutrients, and
chemical messengers diffuse out (leave) and carbon dioxide and other waste products diffuse in (enter). Veins have valves that keep the blood flowing toward the
heart.
The primary function of the cardiovascular system is the transport of oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, nutrients, waste products and chemical messengers.
Processes involved in the cardiovascular system include the cardiac cycle and cardiac and conductive pathway which is measured by electrocardiograms and
blood pressure.
Homeostatic imbalances are explored. These include, but are not limited to, a variety of cardiovascular diseases and structural imperfections of the heart, valves
and vessels. Examples include, but are not limited to, myocardial infarction, aneurysm, atherosclerosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypo/hypertension and
arrhythmias. Investigations are used to understand and explain the cardiovascular system in a variety of inquiry and design scenarios that can incorporate
evolutionary concepts, scientific reasoning, comparative analysis, communication skills and real-world applications.

OHIO’S LEARNING STANDARDS | Science | ADOPTED 2018
AP.T.3: Lymphatic and immune system
The lymphatic system includes lymph, lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes and the immune system. The lymphatic system has multiple, interrelated functions. They
include the removal of fluid from tissues, absorption of large fatty acids in small intestines and transport of white blood cells to the lymph nodes. The immune
system consists of white blood cells that destroy foreign antigens. Tissue fluid that has entered into lymphatic capillaries becomes lymph. Multiple lymphatic
capillaries form lymphatic vessels. As lymph circulates through the body, it passes through multiple lymph nodes. These lymph nodes contain lymphocytes which
destroy foreign antigens.
Processes of the lymphatic system include defense through nonspecific and specific resistance. Examples of nonspecific resistance include mechanical barriers
such as the skin, enzymes, species resistance and mucous membranes. In specific resistance, antibodies are produced that defend the body against foreign
antigens. Memory cells are produced following an infection that allow for possible immunity against a specific antigen upon re-exposure. A comparison of primary
versus secondary immune responses can be explored. Homeostatic imbalances are explored. These include, but are not limited to, autoimmune disorders,
parasitic diseases, allergies, bacterial versus viral infections and ringworm. Vaccinations provide the body with either long-term protection or short-term protection
against many pathogens. Investigations are used to understand and explain the lymphatic system in a variety of inquiry and design scenarios that can incorporate
evolutionary concepts, scientific reasoning, comparative analysis, communication skills and real-world applications.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: ABSORPTION AND EXCRETION
AP.AE.1: Digestive system
The digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal tract (alimentary canal) as well as various accessory organs including the teeth, tongue, salivary glands, liver,
gallbladder and pancreas.
The digestive system processes and supplies the molecules needed to sustain the living tissues within the body through the absorption of nutrients. Six major
functions of the digestive system include secretion, ingestion, mechanical processing, enzymatic digestion, absorption and excretion. The lining of the digestive
system protects surrounding tissues from the mechanical and enzymatic stresses of the digestive process.
Processes of the digestive system include the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into small molecules which are then absorbed by the digestive tract.
Specific actions within the digestive system include mastication, peristalsis, segmentation and the release of hormones and enzymes necessary for digestion. The
metabolic functions of the accessory organs play strategic roles in the breakdown of food products, the maintenance of glucose levels within the blood and the
regulation of homeostasis in the body. Indigestible material is excreted as waste. Homeostatic imbalances are explored. These include, but are not limited to,
conditions such as gallstones, heartburn, ulcers, dehydration, diarrhea, cirrhosis and cancers of the digestive system. Investigations are used to understand and
explain the digestive system in a variety of inquiry and design scenarios that can incorporate evolutionary concepts, scientific reasoning, comparative analysis,
communication skills and real-world applications.
AP.AE.2: Respiratory system
The respiratory system is comprised of the airways, lungs and diaphragm. The airways include the nasal and oral cavities, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi,
bronchioles and alveoli. The respiratory system transports and exchanges gases including oxygen and carbon dioxide.
Processes involved in the respiratory system include respiration mechanics and gas exchange. Respiration mechanics is the process by which humans breathe
and includes the movement of the diaphragm and pressure-volume relationships. Gas exchange refers to the diffusion of gas across the alveolar epithelium in the
respiratory system and capillary endothelium of the cardiovascular system. Lung volumes and capacities can be measured using spirometry. Homeostatic
imbalances are explored. These include, but are not limited to, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis and the effects
of smoking and pollution. Investigations are used to understand and explain the respiratory system in a variety of inquiry and design scenarios that can incorporate
evolutionary concepts, scientific reasoning, comparative analysis, communication skills and real-world applications.

AP.AE.3: Urinary system
The urinary system is a regulatory system that helps maintain homeostasis. The structures of the urinary system include the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra.
Each kidney consists of the renal cortex, medulla and renal pyramids. The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron. The renal pelvis is a funnel-shaped chamber
that is connected to the ureter.
The primary functions of the urinary system are excretion, elimination and regulation of blood volume and pressure. Processes of the urinary system include
filtration, reabsorption and secretion, which occurs in the nephrons. Urine is normally a clear, yellow, sterile solution but the composition can vary slightly between
individuals. Urinalysis is a diagnostic tool for detecting substances and conditions in the body. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and aldosterone hormones influence the
volume and concentration of urine. Caffeine and alcohol act as diuretics and can lead to short or long-term kidney issues. Homeostatic imbalances are explored.
These include, but are not limited to, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, nephritis and acute and chronic kidney disease. Investigations are used to understand
and explain the urinary system in a variety of inquiry and design scenarios that can incorporate evolutionary concepts, scientific reasoning, comparative analysis,
communication skills and real-world applications.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.

CONTENT ELABORATION: REPRODUCTION
AP.R.1: Reproductive system
The reproductive system is comprised of internal and external organs and hormones. The ovaries and testes produce gametes that fuse to form a zygote, a single
cell that develops into an embryo and eventually an adult. A comparison of male and female anatomy should be explored. The female body has the function of
providing protection and nourishment for the developing fetus until birth. If all is successful, a new generation of offspring will occur.
The processes of the reproductive system include oogenesis, spermatogenesis and fertilization. Additional processes can include lactation and menstruation.
Homeostatic imbalances are explored. These include, but are not limited to, infertility, chromosomal disorders, endometriosis, cancer, Human Papillomavirus
(HPV), and sexually transmitted diseases (STD’s). Investigations are used to understand and explain the reproductive system in a variety of inquiry and design
scenarios that can incorporate evolutionary concepts, scientific reasoning, comparative analysis, communication skills and real-world applications.
Note: At this level, a detailed description of embryological development is not required. The focus is on the structure and function of the reproductive organs.
EXPECTATIONS FOR LEARNING
The content in the standards needs to be taught in ways that incorporate the nature of science and engage students in scientific thought processes. Where
possible, real-world data and problem- and project-based experiences should be utilized. Ohio’s Cognitive Demands relate to current understanding and research
about the ways people learn and are important aspects to the overall understanding of science concepts. Care should be taken to provide students opportunities to
engage in all four types of thinking. Additionally, lessons need to be designed so that they incorporate the concepts described in the Nature of Science.
VISIONS INTO PRACTICE: CLASSROOM EXAMPLES
This section provides guidance for developing classroom tasks that go beyond traditional approaches to instruction. It is a springboard for generating innovative
ideas to address the cognitive demands. A variety of activities are presented so that teachers can select those that best meet the needs of their students. This is
not an all-inclusive checklist and is not intended to cover every aspect of the standards. These activities are suggestions and are not mandatory.
