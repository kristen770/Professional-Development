Introduction
The Draft Oklahoma Academic Standards for Science are the result of the contributions of hundreds of science educators, representatives of higher
education, and community members. This document reflects the collaborative work of all members of the Draft Oklahoma Academic Standards for
Science Writing and Draft Committees.
The standards specify what students should know and be able to do as learners of science at the end of each grade level or science course. The
order of the standards at any grade level is not meant to imply a sequence of topics and should be considered flexible for the organization of any
course. The Draft Oklahoma Academic Standards describe the specific areas of student learning that are considered the most important for
proficiency in the discipline at a particular level and provide a basis for the development of local curricula and statewide assessments.
The standards are not a curriculum and they do not represent a scope, sequence, or curriculum guide. They provide a framework for schools and
teachers to develop an aligned science curriculum. They are also designed as coherent progressions of learning in grades PreK-12, intended to be
used as a whole, ensuring all students are provided opportunities to experience science at each grade K-8 and various courses at high school.
Although instruction may go beyond standards, using only a portion of the standards will leave gaps in the scientific understanding and practices of
students.
The Draft Oklahoma Academic Standards for Science were informed by the 2014 Oklahoma Academic Standards for Science, The Framework for K-
12 Science Education (National Academies of Science, 2010), the Next Generation Science Standards (Achieve, Inc., 2012), and other states’
standards documents.
Science is a way of knowing, a process of using observations and investigations to gain knowledge and understanding of the physical and natural
world. The PreK-12 Oklahoma Academic Standards for Science place an emphasis on students being active learners. They showcase that it is not
enough for students to read about science; they must do science. Students must engage in planning and carrying out investigations, making
observations, asking questions, analyzing data, constructing explanations, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and
communicating information to gain the science knowledge and skills to be college, career, and citizen ready upon graduation from high school.

Science Strands Overview
The Draft Oklahoma Academic Standards for Science, K-12 are three-dimensional performance expectations representing the things students
should know, understand, and be able to do to be proficient in science and engineering. Performance expectations are considered standards and
include a science and engineering practice (everyday skills of scientists and engineers), disciplinary core ideas (science ideas used by scientists and
engineers), and crosscutting concepts (ways of thinking like scientists and engineers). The PreK standards emphasize one dimension; the science
and engineering practices. This provides early learners with ample time for exploratory play and background experiences that will inform learning
experiences K-12.
Performance Expectation:
Each Performance Expectation is built upon recommendations in A Framework for K-12 Science Education and the three dimensions of science.
        1. Science and Engineering Practices
        2. Disciplinary Core Ideas
        3. Crosscutting Concepts (NRC, 2012, p. 2)
The following additional components in the standard documents serve as support for instructors in providing clarity and further guidance for each
Performance Expectation.
Clarification Statement:
Where needed, a Clarification Statement accompanies a Performance Expectation. The aim of a Clarification Statement is to provide further
explanation or examples to better support educators in understanding the aim of the Performance Expectation.
Assessment Boundary:
Where applicable, an Assessment Boundary accompanies a Performance Expectation in order to provide additional support for educators in
understanding the intent of the Performance Expectation and its relation to other Performance Expectations in the learning progression. Teachers
should utilize the Assessment Boundaries as tools for developing curriculum and local assessments. For 5th grade, 8th grade, Biology, and Physical
Science(s) the Assessement Boundaries will be utilized to inform the development of the state summative academic achievement assessments.

Dimension 1: Science and Engineering Practices
The Science and Engineering Practices describe the major practices that scientists employ as they investigate and build models and theories about
the world, and a key set of engineering practices that engineers use as they design and build systems. Performance Expectations that emphasize
engineering are designated with an asterik *. The eight science and engineering practices are:

Dimension 2: Disciplinary Core Ideas
Disciplinary Core Ideas represent a set of science and engineering ideas for K-12 science education that have broad importance across multiple
sciences or engineering disciplines; provide a key tool for understanding or investigating more complex ideas and solving problems; relate to the
interests and life experiences of students; and are teachable and learnable over multiple grades at increasing levels of sophistication. (NRC, 2012, p.
31) Disciplinary Core Ideas are grouped into four domains:
        Domain 1: Physical Science (PS)                                           to invisibly small and provide students opportunities to understand how the

        living organisms. The study of life ranges over scales from single
        molecules, organisms and ecosystems, to the entire biosphere. A
        core principle of the life sciences is that organisms are related
        through common ancestry and that processes of natural selection
        have led to the tremendous diversity of the biosphere. Through
        courses like Biology and Environmental Science, students explore all
        aspects of living things and the environments they live in.
Domain 3: Earth and Space Science (ESS)
Through Earth and Space Sciences (ESS), students investigate processes that
operate on Earth and also address Earth’s place in the solar system and the
galaxy. ESS involve phenomena that range in scale from unimaginably large

Dimension 3: Crosscutting Concepts
The Crosscutting Concepts represent common threads or themes that span across science disciplines (biology, chemistry, physics, environmental
science, Earth/space science) and have value to both scientists and engineers because they identify universal properties and processes found in all
disciplines. These Crosscutting Concepts are:
         Patterns                                                                  Tracking fluxes of energy and matter into, out of, and within systems
         Observed patterns of forms and events guide organization           and    helps one understand the system’s possibilities and limitations.

         structure or performance.
   Systems and System Models
    Defining the system under study—specifying its boundaries and making
    explicit a model of that system—provides tools for understanding and
    testing ideas that are applicable throughout science and engineering.

    K.PS2.1 Plan and conduct an investigation to compare the effects of different strengths or different directions of pushes and pulls on the motion of an object.
    Clarification Statement: Example investigations include observing the movement of different objects being pulled by a string, observing different objects
    pushed on a surface and up and down a ramp, or observing how two objects (e.g., toy cars, balls) interact when they collide. Observations should be collected
    directly through exploratory play with opportunities to work with peers to share ideas for investigations and observations. Assessment Boundary: Assessment is
    limited to different relative strengths or different directions, but not both at the same time. Assessment does not include non-contact pushes or pulls such as
    those produced by magnets.

    K.PS2.2 Analyze data to determine if a design solution works as intended to change the speed or direction of an object with a push or pull.*
    Clarification Statement: Data should be limited to observational data collected through exploration-based play of simple design solutions to address problems.
    Example problems include having an object (e.g., toy car or ball) move a certain distance, follow a particular path, or knock down other objects. Designed
    solutions could include using or building a ramp to increase the speed of the object, using objects that would cause an object like a toy car or ball to follow a
    particular path. Emphasis is on basic play as a means to develop a designed solution and test that design. Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include
    friction as a mechanism for change in speed.

    3.PS2.1 Plan and conduct investigations on the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object.
    Clarification Statement: Examples could include that an unbalanced force on one side of a ball can make it start moving and balanced forces pushing on a box
    from opposite sides will not produce any motion at all. Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to one variable at a time: number, size, or direction of
    forces. Assessment does not include quantitative force size, only qualitative and relative. Assessment is limited to gravity being addressed as a force that pulls
    objects down.

    3.LS3.1 Analyze and interpret data to provide evidence that plants and animals have traits inherited from parents and that variation of these traits exists in a
    group of similar organisms.
    Clarification Statement: Patterns are the similarities and differences in traits shared between offspring and their parents, or among siblings. Emphasis is on
    organisms other than humans. Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include genetic mechanisms of inheritance and prediction of traits. Assessment is

    6.ESS2.5 Collect data to provide evidence for how the motions and complex interactions of air masses result in changes in weather conditions.
    Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how air masses flow from regions of high pressure to low pressure, causing weather (defined by temperature, pressure,
    humidity, precipitation, and wind) at a fixed location to change over time, and how sudden changes in weather can result when different air masses interact.
    Emphasis is on how weather can be predicted within probabilistic ranges. Examples of data can be provided to students (such as weather maps, diagrams, and
    visualizations) or obtained through laboratory experiments (such as with condensation). Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include recalling the
    names of cloud types or weather symbols used on weather maps or the reported diagrams from weather stations.

    6.ESS2.6 Develop and use a model to describe how unequal heating and rotation of the Earth causes patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that
    determine regional climates.
    Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how patterns vary by latitude, altitude, and geographic land distribution. Emphasis of atmospheric circulation is on the
    sunlight-driven latitudinal banding, the Coriolis effect, and resulting prevailing winds; emphasis of ocean circulation (e.g., Gulf Stream, North Pacific Drift,
    California Current) is on the transfer of heat by the global ocean convection cycle, which is constrained by the Coriolis effect and the outlines of continents.
    Interactions between the atmosphere and oceans can affect the ocean’s surface temperature (El Nino/La Nina). Examples of models can be diagrams, maps and
    globes, or digital representations. Assessment Boundary: Assessment should not be focused on specific weather events, but on the patterns that drive Earth’s
    climate systems.

    Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on how some natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions and severe weather, are preceded by phenomena that allow for
    reliable predictions, but others, such as earthquakes, occur suddenly and with no notice, and thus are not yet predictable. Examples of natural hazards can be
    taken from interior processes (such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions), surface processes (such as mass wasting and tsunamis), or severe weather events
    (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods). Examples of data can include the locations, magnitudes, and frequencies of the natural hazards. Examples of
    technologies can be global (such as satellite systems to monitor hurricanes or forest fires), or local (such as building basements in tornado-prone regions or
    reservoirs to mitigate droughts). Assessment Boundary: N/A

    ES.ESS2.2 Analyze geoscience data to make the claim that one change to Earth’s surface can create feedbacks and interactions that cause changes to other
    Earth’s systems.
    Clarification Statement: Examples could be taken from system interactions, such as how the loss of ground vegetation causes an increase in water runoff and
    soil erosion, which limits additional vegetation patterns; how dammed rivers increase groundwater recharge, decrease sediment transport, and increased coastal
    erosion; or how the loss of wetlands causes a decrease in local humidity that further reduces the wetland extent. Examples could also include climate feedbacks
    that increase surface temperatures through geologic time.

    Earth systems.
    Clarification Statement: Examples could be taken from system interactions, such as how the loss of ground vegetation causes an increase in water runoff and
    soil erosion, which limits additional vegetation patterns; how dammed rivers increase groundwater recharge, decrease sediment transport, and increase coastal
    erosion; or how the loss of wetlands causes a decrease in local humidity that further reduces the wetland extent. Examples could also include climate feedbacks
    that increase surface temperatures through geologic time.
