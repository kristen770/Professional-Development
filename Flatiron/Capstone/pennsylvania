                                                  VIII. INTRODUCTION
This document describes what students should know and be able to do in the following eight areas:
                 ◊   3.1. Unifying Themes of Science            ◊  3.5. Earth Sciences
                 ◊   3.2. Inquiry and Design                    ◊  3.6. Technology Education
                 ◊   3.3. Biological Sciences                   ◊  3.7. Technological Devices
                 ◊   3.4. Physical Science, Chemistry           ◊  3.8. Science, Technology and Human Endeavors
                         and Physics
These standards describe what students should know and be able to do by the end of fourth, seventh, tenth and twelfth grade. In
addition, these standards reflect the increasing complexity and sophistication that students are expected to achieve as they progress
through school.
This document avoids repetition, making an obvious progression across grade levels less explicit. Teachers shall expect that students
know and can apply the concepts and skills expressed at the preceding level. Consequently, previous learning is reinforced but not
retaught.
Standards are arranged by categories, for example, 3.5 Earth Science. Under each category are standard statements that are preceded
by a capital letter; for example, in 3.1 Unifying Themes, grade 10.B, "Describe concepts of models as a way to predict and understand
science and technology." Following the standard statements are bulleted standard descriptors, which explain the nature and scope of
the standard. Descriptors specify the nature of the standard and the level of complexity needed in meeting that standard in a proficient
manner. Descriptors serve to benchmark the standard statement. Curriculum, instruction and assessment should focus on meeting the
standard statement. Technology Education, computer applications and science are separate curricular areas. Meeting standards
should be approached as a collaborative effort among all curricular areas.
                                                                                                                                       1
22 Pa. Code, Ch. 4, Appendix B                    Final Form                                        January 5, 2002


                               Academic Standards for Science and Technology
The following descriptors explain the intent of each standard category:
3.1. Unifying Themes                 Unifying themes of science and technology provide big ideas that integrate with significant
                                     concepts. There are only a few fundamental concepts and processes that form the framework
                                     upon which science and technology knowledges are organized - motion and forces, energy,
                                     structure of matter, change over time and machines. These themes create the context through
                                     which the content of the disciplines can be taught and are emphasized in each standard.
3.2. Inquiry and Design              The nature of science and technology is characterized by applying process knowledge that
                                     enables students to become independent learners. These skills include observing, classifying,
                                     inferring, predicting, measuring, computing, estimating, communicating, using space/time
                                     relationships, defining operationally, raising questions, formulating hypotheses, testing and
                                     experimenting, designing controlled experiments, recognizing variables, manipulating variables,
                                     interpreting data, formulating models, designing models, and producing solutions. Everyone can
                                     use them to solve real-life problems. These process skills are developed across the grade levels
                                     and differ in the degree of sophistication, quantitative nature and application to the content.
3.3. Biological Sciences             Biology concerns living things, their appearance, different types of life, the scope of their
                                     similarities and differences, where they live and how they live. Living things are made of the
                                     same components as all other matter, involve the same kinds of transformations of energy and
                                     move using the same basic kinds of forces as described in chemistry and physics standards.
                                     Through the study of the diversity of life, students learn to understand how life has changed over
                                     a long period of time. This great variety of life forms continues to change even today as genetic
                                     instructions within cells are passed from generation to generation, yet the amazing integrity of
                                     most species remain.
 3.4. Physical Science               Physics and chemistry involve the study of objects and
      Chemistry and Physics          their properties. Students examine changes to materials during mixing, freezing, heating and
                                     dissolving and then learn how to observe and measure results. In chemistry students study the
                                     relationship between matter, atomic structure and its activity. Laboratory investigations of
                                     the properties of substances and their changes through a range of chemical interactions provide a
                                     basis for students to understand atomic theory and a variety of reaction types and their
                                                                                                                                       2
22 Pa. Code, Ch. 4, Appendix B                   Final Form                                         January 5, 2002

                                   applications in business, agriculture and medicine. Physics deepens the understanding of the
                                   structure and properties of materials and includes atoms, waves, light, electricity, magnetism and
                                   the role of energy, forces and motion.
3.5. Earth Sciences                The dynamics of earth science include the studies of forces of nature that build the earth and
                                   wear down the earth. The understanding of these concepts uses principles from physical
                                   sciences, geography and mathematics.
3.6. Technology Education          Technology education is the use of accumulated knowledge to process resources to meet human
                                   needs and improve the quality of life. Students develop the ability to select and correctly use
                                   materials, tools, techniques and processes to answer questions, understand explanations and
                                   solve problems encountered in real life situations. These overriding themes require students to
                                   design, create, use, evaluate and modify systems of Biotechnologies, Information Technologies,
                                   and Physical Technologies.
3.7. Technological Devices         Students use tools to observe, measure, move and make things. New technological tools and
                                   techniques make it possible to enact far-reaching changes in our world. Technology enhances the
                                   students' abilities to identify problems and determine solutions. Computers play an integral role
                                   in every day life by extending our abilities to collect, analyze and communicate information and
                                   ideas.
3.8. Science, Technology and       Scientific knowledge and societal needs often create a demand for new technology. Conversely,
       Human Endeavors             new technology advances scientific knowledge. Both influence society through the impact of
                                   their products and processes.
                                                                                                                                     3

What Is Science? Any study of science includes the search for understanding the natural world and facts, principles, theories and
laws that have been verified by the scientific community and are used to explain and predict natural phenomena and events.
Acquiring scientific knowledge involves constructing hypotheses using observation and knowledge in the content area in order to
formulate useful questions that provoke scientific inquiry. As a result of repeated, rigorous testing over time and applying multiple
perspectives to a problem, consistent information emerges. A theory describes this verifiable event or phenomena. Theories are
powerful elements in science and are used to predict other events. As theories lose their ability to predict, they are modified,
expanded or generalized or incorporated into a broader theory.
Knowledge of what science is incorporates carefully developed and integrated components:
        •    Nature of science -- the ways in which scientists search for answers to questions and explanations of observations about
             the natural world; includes process knowledge of observing, classifying, inferring, predicting, measuring, hypothesizing,
             experimenting and interpreting data
        •    Unifying themes of science -- concepts, generalizations and principles that result from and lead to inquiry
        •    Knowledge -- facts, principles, theories and laws verifiable through scientific inquiry by the world community of
             scientists; includes physics, chemistry, earth science and biological sciences
        •    Inquiry -- an intellectual process of logic that includes verification of answers to questions about and explanations for
             natural objects, events and phenomena
        •    Process skills -- Recognition by students how knowledge is acquired and applied in science by observing, classifying,
             inferring, predicting, measuring, computing, estimating, communicating, using space/time relationships, defining
             operationally, formulating hypotheses, testing and experimenting, designing controlled experiments, recognizing variables,
             manipulating variables, interpreting data, formulating models, designing models and producing solutions.
        •    Problem solving -- application of concepts to problems of human adaptation to the environment that often leads to
             recognition of new problems; has social implications and leads to personal decision-making and action; a process which
             forms the link for interactions between scientific and technological results or findings; involves operational definitions,
             recognizing variables, formulating models and asking questions
        •    Scientific thinking -- the disposition to suspend judgment, not make decisions and not take action until results,
             explanations or answers have been tested and verified with information.

What Is Technology Education? It is the means by which we teach technology. Technology is a body of knowledge separate from
but related to the sciences, with specific content, curriculum and specific certification requirements. Technology is the application of
tools, materials, processes and systems by humans to solve problems and provide benefits to humankind. We use technology in an
attempt to improve our environment. These improvements may relate to survival needs (e.g., food, shelter, defense) or they may relate
to human aspirations (e.g., knowledge, art, control). They can include unexpected benefits, unexpected costs and unexpected risks.
Technology education involves a broad spectrum of knowledge and activities. Effective technology education combines knowledge
of content, process and skills to provide students with a holistic approach to learning. Technology education offers unique
opportunities to apply numerous academic concepts through practical, hands-on applications. Instructional technology, on the other
hand, deals specifically with use of computers and different software to solve problems and communicate effectively. Knowledge of
content, process and skills should be used together to effectively engage students and promote a complete understanding of the
sciences, related technologies and their interrelationship. The relationship between science and technology is one where science builds
principles or theories and technology provides the practical application of those principles or theories.
Knowledge of content, process and skills in technology involves learning processes that include these components:
                     • Methods of designing and developing solutions
                     • Standards for selecting and using appropriate materials, tools and processes
                     • Experimental and design specifications for testing and evaluating solutions
                     • Criteria for judging the performance and impact of the solutions
                     • Evaluating the impact of modifying a system to improve performance.
