              UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS
                                     The Utah State Board of Education, in January of
                                     1984, established policy requiring the identification
                                     of specific core standards to be met by all K–12 stu-
                                     dents in order to graduate from Utah’s secondary
                                     schools. The Utah State Board of Education regularly
                                     updates the Utah Core Standards, while parents,
                                     teachers, and local school boards continue to control
                                     the curriculum choices that reflect local values.
                                     The Utah Core Standards are aligned to scientifically
                                     based content standards. They drive high quality in-
                                     struction through statewide comprehensive expec-
                                     tations for all students. The standards outline essen-
                                     tial knowledge, concepts, and skills to be mastered
                                     at each grade level or within a critical content area.
                                     The standards provide a foundation for ensuring
                                     learning within the classroom.

Utah Science with Engineering
Education Standards
Utah’s Science and Engineering Education (SEEd) standards were written by Utah educators
and scientists, using a wide array of resources and expertise. A great deal is known about good
science instruction. The writing team used sources including A Framework for K–12 Science
Education1, the Next Generation Science Standards2, and related works to craft research-based
standards for Utah. These standards were written with students in mind, including develop-
mentally appropriate progressions that foster learning that is simultaneously age-appropriate
and enduring. The aim was to address what an educated citizenry should know and under-
stand to embrace the value of scientific thinking and make informed decisions. The SEEd stan-
dards are founded on what science is, how science is learned, and the multiple dimensions of
scientific work.
Principles of Scientific Literacy
Science is a way of knowing, a process for understanding the natural world. Engineering ap-
plies the fields of science, technology, and mathematics to produce solutions to real-world
problems. The process of developing scientific knowledge includes ongoing questioning, test-
ing, and refinement of ideas when supported by empirical evidence. Since progress in modern
society is tied so closely to this way of knowing, scientific literacy is essential for a society to
be engaged in political and economic choices on personal, local, regional, and global scales.
As such, the Utah SEEd standards are based on the following essential elements of scientific
literacy.
   Science is valuable, relevant, and applicable.
   Science produces knowledge that is inherently important to our society and culture.
   Science and engineering support innovation and enhance the lives of individuals and so-
   ciety. Science is supported from and benefited by an equitable and democratic culture.
   Science is for all people, at all levels of education, and from all backgrounds.
   Science is a shared way of knowing and doing.
   Science learning experiences should celebrate curiosity, wonder, skepticism, precision, and
   accuracy. Scientific habits of mind include questioning, communicating, reasoning, analyz-
   ing, collaborating, and thinking critically. These values are shared within and across scien-
   tific disciplines, and should be embraced by students, teachers, and society at large.
   Science is principled and enduring.
   Scientific knowledge is constructed from empirical evidence; therefore, it is both change-
   able and durable. Science is based on observations and inferences, an understanding of
   scientific laws and theories, use of scientific methods, creativity, and collaboration. The
   Utah SEEd standards are based on current scientific theories, which are powerful and
   broad explanations of a wide range of phenomena; they are not simply guesses nor are
                                                                                                       INTRODUCTION | 9
   they unchangeable facts. Science is principled in that it is limited to observable evidence.
   Science is also enduring in that theories are only accepted when they are robustly sup-
   ported by multiple lines of peer reviewed evidence. The history of science demonstrates


                    UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS
                        how scientific knowledge can change and progress, and it is rooted in the cultures from which
                        it emerged. Scientists, engineers, and society, are responsible for developing scientific under-
                        standings with integrity, supporting claims with existing and new evidence, interpreting com-
                        peting explanations of phenomena, changing models purposefully, and finding applications
                        that are ethical.
                     Principles of Science Learning
                     Just as science is an active endeavor, students best learn science by engaging in it. This includes
                     gathering information through observations, reasoning, and communicating with others. It is not
                     enough for students to read about or watch science from a distance; learners must become active
                     participants in forming their ideas and engaging in scientific practice. The Utah SEEd standards
                     are based on several core philosophical and research-based underpinnings of science learning.
                        Science learning is personal and engaging.
                        Research in science education supports the assertion that students at all levels learn most
                        when they are able to construct and reflect upon their ideas, both by themselves and in col-
                        laboration with others. Learning is not merely an act of retaining information but creating
                        ideas informed by evidence and linked to previous ideas and experiences. Therefore, the most
                        productive learning settings engage students in authentic experiences with natural phenom-
                        ena or problems to be solved. Learners develop tools for understanding as they look for pat-
                        terns, develop explanations, and communicate with others. Science education is most effec-
                        tive when learners invests in their own sense-making and their learning context provides an
                        opportunity to engage with real-world problems.
                        Science learning is multi-purposed.
                        Science learning serves many purposes. We learn science because it brings us joy and appre-
                        ciation but also because it solves problems, expands understanding, and informs society. It
                        allows us to make predictions, improve our world, and mitigate challenges. An understand-
                        ing of science and how it works is necessary in order to participate in a democratic society. So,
                        not only is science a tool to be used by the future engineer or lab scientist but also by every
                        citizen, every artist, and every other human who shares an appreciation for the world in which
                        we live.
                        All students are capable of science learning.
                        Science learning is a right of all individuals and must be accessible to all students in equitable
                        ways. Independent of grade level, geography, gender, economic status, cultural background,
                        or any other demographic descriptor, all K–12 students are capable of science learning and
                        science literacy. Science learning is most equitable when students have agency and can en-
                        gage in practices of science and sense-making for themselves, under the guidance and men-
                        toring of an effective teacher and within an environment that puts student experience at the
                        center of instruction. Moreover, all students are capable learners of science, and all grades and
                        classes should provide authentic, developmentally appropriate science instruction.

Three Dimensions of Science
Science is composed of multiple types of knowledge and tools. These include the processes of
doing science, the structures that help us organize and connect our understandings, and the
deep explanatory pieces of knowledge that provide predictive power. These facets of science
are represented as “three dimensions” of science learning, and together these help us to make
sense of all that science does and represents. These include science and engineering prac-
tices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas. Taken together, these represent how
we use science to make sense of phenomena, and they are most meaningful when learned in
concert with one another. These are described in A Framework for K–12 Science Education, ref-
erenced above, and briefly described here:
   Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs): Practices refer to the things that scientists and
   engineers do and how they actively engage in their work. Scientists do much more than
   make hypotheses and test them with experiments. They engage in wonder, design, mod-
   eling, construction, communication, and collaboration. The practices describe the variety
   of activities that are necessary to do science, and they also imply how scientific thinking
   is related to thinking in other subjects, including math, writing, and the arts. For a further
   understanding of science and engineering practices see Chapter 3 in A Framework for K–12
   Science Education.
   Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs): Crosscutting concepts are the organizing structures that
   provide a framework for assembling pieces of scientific knowledge. They reach across dis-
   ciplines and demonstrate how specific ideas are united into overarching principles. For
   example, a mechanical engineer might design some process that transfers energy from a
   fuel source into a moving part, while a biologist might study how predators and prey are
   interrelated. Both of these would need to model systems of energy to understand how all
   of the features interact, even though they are studying different subjects. Understanding
   crosscutting concepts enables us to make connections among different subjects and to
   utilize science in diverse settings. Additional information on crosscutting concepts can be
   found in Chapter 4 of A Framework for K-12 Science Education.
   Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs): Core ideas within the SEEd Standards include those most
   fundamental and explanatory pieces of knowledge in a discipline. They are often what we
   traditionally associate with science knowledge and specific subject areas within science.
   These core ideas are organized within physical, life, and earth sciences, but within each
   area further specific organization is appropriate. All these core ideas are described in chap-
   ters 5 through 8 in the K–12 Framework text, and these are employed by the Utah SEEd
   standards to help clarify the focus of each strand in a grade level or content area.
   Even though the science content covered by SEPs, CCCs, and DCIs is substantial, the Utah
   SEEd standards are not meant to address every scientific concept. Instead, these standards
   were written to address and engage in an appropriate depth of knowledge, including per-
   spectives into how that knowledge is obtained and where it fits in broader contexts, for
   students to continue to use and expand their understandings over a lifetime.
                                                                                                    INTRODUCTION | 11

                             UTAH SCIENCE WITH ENGINEERING EDUCATION (SEEd) STANDARDS
Organization of Standards
  The Utah SEEd standards are organized into strands which represent significant areas of
  learning within grade level progressions and content areas. Each strand introduction is an
  orientation for the teacher in order to provide an overall view of the concepts needed for
  foundational understanding. These include descriptions of how the standards tie together
  thematically and which DCIs are used to unite that theme. Within each strand are stan-
  dards. A standard is an articulation of how a learner may demonstrate their proficiency,
  incorporating not only the disciplinary core idea but also a crosscutting concept and a sci-
  ence and engineering practice. While a standard represents an essential element of what
  is expected, it does not dictate curriculum—it only represents a proficiency level for that
  grade. While some standards within a strand may be more comprehensive than others, all
  standards are essential for a comprehensive understanding of a strand’s purpose.
  The standards of any given grade or course are not independent. SEEd standards are writ-
  ten with developmental levels and learning progressions in mind so that many topics are
  built upon from one grade to another. In addition, SEPs and CCCs are especially well paral-
  leled with other disciplines, including English language arts, fine arts, mathematics, and
  social sciences. Therefore, SEEd standards should be considered to exist not as an island
  unto themselves, but as a part of an integrated, comprehensive, and holistic educational
  experience.
  Each standard is framed upon the three dimensions of science to represent a cohesive,
  multi-faceted science learning outcome.
     Within each SEEd Standard Science and Engineering Practices are bolded.
     Crosscutting Concepts are underlined.
     Disciplinary Core Ideas are added to the standard in normal font with the relevant
       DCIs codes from the K–12 Framework (indicated in parentheses after each standard)
       to provide further clarity.
     Standards with specific engineering expectations are italicized.
     Many standards contain additional emphasis and example statements that clarify the
       learning goals for students.
       Emphasis statements highlight a required and necessary part of the student
         learning to satisfy that standard.
       Example statements help to clarify the meaning of the standard and are not
         required for instruction.
                                                                                                 INTRODUCTION | 13

INTRODUCTION
  The kindergarten SEEd standards provide a framework for students to obtain, evaluate,
  and communicate information about how the Sun causes our weather patterns and how
  these patterns affect living systems. Students analyze information about the needs of liv-
  ing things (plants and animals, including humans) and how living things interact with their
  surroundings. Students investigate the effects of forces through push and pull interac-
  tions. Additionally, students design and evaluate solutions to problems that exist in these
  areas.

                         Strand K.1: WEATHER PATTERNS
                        Weather is the combination of sunlight, wind, snow or rain, and temperature in a particular re-
                        gion at a particular time. People measure these conditions to describe and record the weather
                        to identify patterns over time. Weather scientists forecast severe weather so that communities
                        can prepare for and respond to these events. Sunlight warms Earth’s surface.

 Strand K.2: LIVING THINGS AND THEIR SURROUNDINGS
Living things (plants and animals, including humans) depend on their surroundings to get
what they need, including food, water, shelter, and a favorable temperature. The characteris-
tics of surroundings influence where living things are naturally found. Plants and animals af-
fect and respond to their surroundings.
Standard K.2.1 Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information to describe patterns
                 of what living things (plants and animals, including humans) need to
                 survive. Emphasize the similarities and differences between the survival
                 needs of all living things. Examples could include that plants depend on
                 air, water, minerals, and light to survive, or animals depend on plants or
                 other animals to survive. (LS1.C)
Standard K.2.2 Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about patterns in
                 the relationships between the needs of different living things (plants and
                 animals, including humans) and the places they live. Emphasize that living
                 things need water, air, and resources and that they live in places that have
                 the things they need. Examples could include investigating plants grown
                 in various locations and comparing the results or comparing animals with
                 the places they live. (LS2.B, ESS3.A)
Standard K.2.3 Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about how living
                 things (plants and animals, including humans) affect their surroundings
                 to survive. Examples could include squirrels digging in the ground to hide
                 their food, plant roots breaking concrete, or humans building shelters.
                 (ESS2.E)
Standard K.2.4 Design and communicate a solution to address the effects that living
                 things (plants and animals, including humans) experience while trying
                 to survive in their surroundings. Define the problem by asking questions
                 and gathering information, convey designs through sketches, drawings, or
                 physical models, and compare designs. Emphasize students working from
                 a plant, animal, or human perspective. Examples could include a plant
                 growing to get more sunlight, a beaver building a dam, or humans caring
                 for the Earth by reusing and recycling natural resources. (ESS3.C, ETS1.A,

                         Strand K.3: FORCES, MOTION, AND INTERACTIONS
                        The motion of objects can be observed and described. Pushing or pulling on an object can
                        change the speed or direction of an object’s motion and can start or stop it. Pushes and pulls
                        can have different strengths and different directions. A bigger push or pull makes things go
                        faster and when objects touch or collide, they push on one another and can change motion.
                        Standard K.3.1 Plan and conduct an investigation to compare the effects of different
                                         strengths or different directions of forces on the motion of an object.
                                         Emphasize forces as a push and pull on an object. The idea of strength
                                         should be kept separate from the idea of direction. Non-contact forces,
                                         such as magnets and static electricity, will be taught in Grades 3 through
                                         5. (PS2.A, PS2.B, PS2.C, PS3.C)

                                         in the speed or direction of an object with a push or a pull. Define the
                                         problem by asking questions and gathering information, convey designs
                                         through sketches, drawings, or physical models, and compare and test
                                         designs. Examples of problems requiring a solution could include having
                                         a marble or other object move a certain distance, follow a particular path,
                                         or knock down other objects. (PS2.A, PS2.B, PS2.C, PS3.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B,

                   Seasonal patterns of motion of the Sun, Moon, and stars can be observed, described, and pre-
                   dicted. These patterns may vary depending on the region, location, or time of year.

 Strand 1.2: THE NEEDS OF LIVING THINGS AND THEIR OFFSPRING
Living things (plants and animals, including humans) depend on their surroundings to get
what they need, including food, water, shelter, and a favorable temperature. Plants and ani-
mals have external features that allow them to survive in a variety of environments. Young
plants and animals are similar but not exactly like their parents. In many kinds of animals, par-
ents and offspring engage in behaviors that help the offspring to survive.
Standard 1.2.1 Plan and carry out an investigation to determine the effect of sunlight
                 and water on plant growth. Emphasize investigations that test one
                 variable at a time. (LS1.C)
Standard 1.2.2 Construct an explanation by observing patterns of external features of
                 living things that survive in different locations. Emphasize how plants and
                 nonhuman animals, found in specific surroundings, share similar physical
                 characteristics. Examples could include that plants living in dry areas are
                 more likely to have thick outer coatings that hold in water, animals living
                 in cold locations have longer and thicker fur, or most desert animals are
                 awake at night. (LS1.A, LS1.D)
Standard 1.2.3 Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about the patterns
                 of plants and nonhuman animals that are alike, but not exactly like, their
                 parents. An example could include that most carrots are orange and
                 shaped like a cone but may be different sizes or have differing tastes.

Standard 1.2.4 Construct an explanation of the patterns in the behaviors of parents and
                 offspring which help offspring to survive. Examples of behavioral patterns
                 could include the signals that offspring make such as crying, chirping,
                 and other vocalizations or the responses of the parents such as feeding,
                 comforting, and protecting the offspring. (LS1.B)

                    Strand 1.3: LIGHT AND SOUND
                   Sound can make matter vibrate, and vibrating matter can make sound. Objects can only be
                   seen when light is available to illuminate them. Some objects give off their own light. Some
                   materials allow light to pass through them, others allow only some light to pass through
                   them, and still others block light and create a dark shadow on the surface beyond them where
                   the light cannot reach. Mirrors can be used to redirect light. People use a variety of devices
                   that may include sound and light to communicate over long distances.

                                    relationship between sound and vibrating matter. Emphasize that
                                    vibrating matter can make sound and that sound can make matter
                                    vibrate. (PS4.A)

                                    in the path of a beam of light. Emphasize that light can travel through
                                    some materials, can be reflected off some materials, and some materials
                                    block light causing shadows. Examples of materials could include clear

                    Strand 2.1: CHANGES IN THE EARTH’S SURFACE
                   Earth has an ancient history of slow and gradual surface changes, punctuated with quick but
                   powerful geologic events like volcanic eruptions, flooding, and earthquakes. Water and wind
                   play a significant role in changing Earth’s surface. The effects of wind and water can cause
                   both slow and quick changes to the surface of the Earth. Scientists and engineers design solu-
                   tions to slow or prevent wind or water from changing the land.

 Strand 2.2: LIVING THINGS AND THEIR HABITATS
Living things (plants and animals, including humans) need water, air, and resources from the
land to survive and live in habitats that provide these necessities. The physical characteristics
of plants and animals reflect the habitat in which they live. Animals also have modified behav-
iors that help them survive, grow, and meet their needs. Humans sometimes mimic plant and
animal adaptations to survive in their environment.
Standard 2.2.1 Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about patterns
                 of living things (plants and animals, including humans) in different
                 habitats. Emphasize the diversity of living things in land and water
                 habitats. Examples of patterns in habitats could include descriptions of
                 temperature or precipitation and the types of plants and animals found in
                 land habitats. (LS2.C, LS4.C, LS4.D)
Standard 2.2.2 Plan and carry out an investigation of the structure and function of
                 plant and animal parts in different habitats. Emphasize how different
                 plants and animals have different structures to survive in their habitat.
                 Examples could include the shallow roots of a cactus in the desert or the
                 seasonal changes in the fur coat of a wolf. (LS1.A, LS4.A, LS4.D)
Standard 2.2.3 Develop and use a model that mimics the function of an animal
                 dispersing seeds or pollinating plants. Examples could include plants
                 that have seeds with hooks or barbs that attach themselves to animal
                 fur, feathers, or human clothing, or dispersal through the wind, or
                 consumption of fruit and the disposal of the pits or seeds. (LS2.A)
Standard 2.2.4 Design a solution to a human problem by mimicking the structure and
                 function of plants and/or animals and how they use their external parts
                 to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs. Define the problem
                 by asking questions and gathering information, convey designs through
                 sketches, drawings, or physical models, and compare and test designs.
                 Examples could include a human wearing a jacket to mimic the fur of an
                 animal or a webbed foot to design a better swimming fin. (LS1.A, LS1.D,

                    Strand 2.3: PROPERTIES OF MATTER
                   All things are made of matter which exists with different forms and properties. Matter can be
                   described and classified by its observable properties. Materials with certain properties are
                   well-suited for specific uses. Heating or cooling some types of matter may or may not irrevers-
                   ibly change their properties.
                   Standard 2.3.1 Plan and carry out an investigation to classify different kinds of
                                    materials based on patterns in their observable properties. Examples
                                    could include sorting materials based on similar properties such as
                                    strength, color, flexibility, hardness, texture, or whether the materials are
                                    solids or liquids. (PS1.A)
                   Standard 2.3.2 Construct an explanation showing how the properties of materials
                                    influence their intended use and function. Examples could include using
                                    wood as a building material because it is lightweight and strong or the
                                    use of concrete, steel, or cotton due to their unique properties. (PS1.A)
                   Standard 2.3.3 Develop and use a model to describe how an object, made of a small
                                    set of pieces, can be disassembled and reshaped into a new object with a
                                    different function. Emphasize that a great variety of objects can be built
                                    from a small set of pieces. Examples of pieces could include wooden
                                    blocks or building bricks. (PS1.A)
                   Standard 2.3.4 Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about changes in
                                    matter caused by heating or cooling. Emphasize that some changes can
                                    be reversed and some cannot. Examples of reversible changes could
                                    include freezing water or melting crayons. Examples of irreversible
                                    changes could include cooking an egg or burning wood. (PS1.B)

INTRODUCTION
The third-grade SEEd standards provide a framework for students to analyze and interpret
data to reveal patterns that indicate typical weather conditions expected during a particular
season. Students develop and use models to describe changes that organisms go through
during their life cycle. Students plan and carry out investigations that provide evidence of the
effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object. Additionally, students
design solutions to problems that exist in these areas.

                    Strand 3.1: WEATHER AND CLIMATE PATTERNS
                   Weather is a minute-by-minute, day-by-day variation of the atmosphere’s condition on a local
                   scale. Scientists record patterns of weather across different times and areas so that they can
                   make weather forecasts. Climate describes a range of an area’s typical weather conditions and
                   the extent to which those conditions vary over a long period of time. A variety of weather-
                   related hazards result from natural processes. While humans cannot eliminate natural hazards,
                   they can take steps to reduce their impact.

                                    students gathering data in a variety of ways and representing data
                                    in tables and graphs. Examples of data could include temperature,
                                    precipitation, or wind speed. (ESS2.D)

 Strand 3.2: EFFECTS OF TRAITS ON SURVIVAL
Organisms (plants and animals, including humans) have unique and diverse life cycles, but
they all follow a pattern of birth, growth, reproduction, and death. Different organisms vary in
how they look and function because they have different inherited traits. An organism’s traits
are inherited from its parents and can be influenced by the environment. Variations in traits
between individuals in a population may provide advantages in surviving and reproducing in
particular environments. When the environment changes, some organisms have traits that al-
low them to survive, some move to new locations, and some do not survive. Humans can de-
sign solutions to reduce the impact of environmental changes on organisms.
Standard 3.2.1 Develop and use models to describe changes that organisms go through
                 during their life cycles. Emphasize that organisms have unique and diverse
                 life cycles but follow a pattern of birth, growth, reproduction, and death.
                 Examples of changes in life cycles could include how some plants and
                 animals look different at different stages of life or how other plants and
                 animals only appear to change size in their life. (LS1.B)
Standard 3.2.2 Analyze and interpret data to identify patterns of traits that plants
                 and animals have inherited from parents. Emphasize the similarities and
                 differences in traits between parent organisms and offspring and variation
                 of traits in groups of similar organisms. (LS3.A, LS3.B)
Standard 3.2.3 Construct an explanation that the environment can affect the traits of an
                 organism. Examples could include that the growth of normally tall plants
                 is stunted with insufficient water or that pets given too much food and
                 little exercise may become overweight. (LS3.B)
Standard 3.2.4 Construct an explanation showing how variations in traits and behaviors
                 can affect the ability of an individual to survive and reproduce. Examples
                 of traits could include large thorns protecting a plant from being eaten
                 or strong smelling flowers to attracting certain pollinators. Examples
                 of behaviors could include animals living in groups for protection or
                 migrating to find more food. (LS2.D, LS4.B)
Standard 3.2.5 Engage in argument from evidence that in a particular habitat (system)
                 some organisms can survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot
                 survive at all. Emphasize that organisms and habitats form systems in
                 which the parts depend upon each other. Examples of evidence could
                 include needs and characteristics of the organisms and habitats involved
                 such as cacti growing in dry, sandy soil but not surviving in wet, saturated
                 soil. (LS4.C)
Standard 3.2.6 Design a solution to a problem caused by a change in the environment
                 that impacts the types of plants and animals living in that environment.
                 Define the problem, identify criteria and constraints, and develop possible
                                                                                                   GRADE 3 | 35
                 solutions. Examples of environmental changes could include changes in
                 land use, water availability, temperature, food, or changes caused by other
                 organisms. (LS2.C, LS4.D, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

                    Strand 3.3: FORCE AFFECTS MOTION
                   Forces act on objects and have both a strength and a direction. An object at rest typically has
                   multiple forces acting on it, but they are balanced, resulting in a zero net force on the object.
                   Forces that are unbalanced can cause changes in an object’s speed or direction of motion. The
                   patterns of an object’s motion in various situations can be observed, measured, and used to
                   predict future motion. Forces are exerted when objects come in contact with each other; how-
                   ever, some forces can act on objects that are not in contact. The gravitational force of Earth,
                   acting on an object near Earth’s surface, pulls that object toward the planet’s center. Electric
                   and magnetic forces between a pair of objects can act at a distance. The strength of these
                   non-contact forces depends on the properties of the objects and the distance between the
                   objects.
                   Standard 3.3.1 Plan and carry out investigations that provide evidence of the effects of
                                    balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object. Emphasize
                                    investigations where only one variable is tested at a time. Examples could
                                    include an unbalanced force on one side of a ball causing it to move
                                    and balanced forces pushing on a box from both sides producing no
                                    movement. (PS2.A, PS2.B)

  The fourth-grade SEEd standards provide a framework for students to construct an expla-
  nation of how structures support growth, behavior, and survival in both plants and ani-
  mals. Students analyze and interpret data from fossils to provide evidence of stability and
  change in ancient organisms and environments. Students plan and carry out an investiga-
  tion to gather evidence that energy can be transferred from place to place by sound, light,
  heat, and electrical currents. Students analyze data and construct explanations for how the
  Sun and Earth interact. Additionally, students design solutions to problems that exist in
  these areas.

                    Strand 4.1: ORGANISMS FUNCTIONING IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT
                   Through the study of organisms, inferences can be made about environments both past and
                   present. Plants and animals have both internal and external structures that serve various func-
                   tions for growth, survival, behavior, and reproduction. Animals use different sense receptors
                   specialized for particular kinds of information to understand and respond to their environ-
                   ment. Some kinds of plants and animals that once lived on Earth can no longer be found.
                   However, fossils from these organisms provide evidence about the types of organisms that
                   lived long ago and the nature of their environments. Additionally, the presence and location
                   of certain fossil types indicate changes that have occurred in environments over time.
                   Standard 4.1.1 Construct an explanation from evidence that plants and animals
                                    have internal and external structures that function to support survival,
                                    growth, behavior, and reproduction. Emphasize how structures support
                                    an organism’s survival in its environment and how internal and external
                                    structures of plants and animals vary within the same and across multiple
                                    Utah environments. Examples of structures could include thorns on
                                    a stem to prevent predation or gills on a fish to allow it to breathe
                                    underwater. (LS1.A)

                                    information. Emphasize how animals are able to use their perceptions
                                    and memories to guide their actions. Examples could include models that
                                    explain how animals sense and then respond to different aspects of their
                                    environment such as sounds, temperature, or smell. (LS1.D)

                                    Emphasize using the structures of fossils to make inferences about
                                    ancient organisms. Examples of fossils and environments could include
                                    comparing a trilobite with a horseshoe crab in an ocean environment or
                                    using a fossil footprint to determine the size of a dinosaur. (LS4.A)

                                    have changed over time. Emphasize the relationship between fossils and
                                    past environments. Examples could include tropical plant fossils found
                                    in Arctic areas and rock layers with marine shell fossils found above rock

 Strand 4.2: ENERGY TRANSFER
Energy is present whenever there are moving objects, sound, light, or heat. The faster a given
object is moving, the more energy it possesses. When objects collide, energy can be trans-
ferred from one object to another causing the objects’ motions to change. Energy can also be
transferred from place to place by electrical currents, heat, sound, or light. Devices can be de-
signed to convert energy from one form to another.
Standard 4.2.1 Construct an explanation to describe the cause and effect relationship
                 between the speed of an object and the energy of that object. Emphasize
                 using qualitative descriptions of the relationship between speed and
                 energy like fast, slow, strong, or weak. An example could include a ball
                 that is kicked hard has more energy and travels a greater distance than a
                 ball that is kicked softly. (PS3.A)
Standard 4.2.2 Ask questions and make observations about the changes in energy
                 that occur when objects collide. Emphasize that energy is transferred
                 when objects collide and may be converted to different forms of energy.
                 Examples could include changes in speed when one moving ball collides
                 with another or the transfer of energy when a toy car hits a wall. (PS3.B,
                 PS3.C)
Standard 4.2.3 Plan and carry out an investigation to gather evidence from
                 observations that energy can be transferred from place to place by sound,
                 light, heat, and electrical currents. Examples could include sound causing
                 objects to vibrate and electric currents being used to produce motion or
                 light. (PS3.A, PS3.B)
Standard 4.2.4 Design a device that converts energy from one form to another. Define
                 the problem, identify criteria and constraints, develop possible solutions using
                 models, analyze data from testing solutions, and propose modifications for
                 optimizing a solution. Emphasize identifying the initial and final forms of
                 energy. Examples could include solar ovens that convert light energy to
                 heat energy or a simple alarm system that converts motion energy into
                 sound energy. (PS3.B, PS3.D, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

                    Strand 4.3: WAVE PATTERNS
                   Waves are regular patterns of motion that transfer energy and have properties such as ampli-
                   tude (height of the wave) and wavelength (spacing between wave peaks). Waves in water can
                   be directly observed. Light waves cause objects to be seen when light reflected from objects
                   enters the eye. Humans use waves and other patterns to transfer information.
                   Standard 4.3.1 Develop and use a model to describe the regular patterns of waves.
                                    Emphasize patterns in terms of amplitude and wavelength. Examples of
                                    models could include diagrams, analogies, and physical models such as
                                    water or rope. (PS4.A)
                   Standard 4.3.2 Develop and use a model to describe how visible light waves reflected
                                    from objects enter the eye causing objects to be seen. Emphasize the
                                    reflection and movement of light. The structure and function of organs
                                    and organ systems and the relationship between color and wavelength
                                    will be taught in Grades 6 through 8. (PS4.B)

                                    propose modifications for optimizing a solution. Examples could include
                                    using light to transmit a message in Morse code or using lenses and
                                    mirrors to see objects that are far away. (PS4.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

 Strand 4.4: OBSERVABLE PATTERNS IN THE SKY
The Sun is a star that appears larger and brighter than other stars because it is closer to Earth.
The rotation of Earth on its axis and orbit of Earth around the Sun cause observable patterns.
These include day and night; daily changes in the length and direction of shadows; and differ-
ent positions of the Sun and stars at different times of the day, month, and year.
Standard 4.4.1 Construct an explanation that differences in the apparent brightness of
                 the Sun compared to other stars is due to the relative distance (scale) of
                 stars from Earth. Emphasize relative distance from Earth. (ESS1.A)
Standard 4.4.2 Analyze and interpret data of observable patterns to show that Earth
                 rotates on its axis and revolves around the Sun. Emphasize patterns that

                    Strand 5.1: CHARACTERISTICS AND INTERACTIONS OF EARTH’S SYSTEMS
                   Earth’s major systems are the geosphere (solid and molten rock, soil, and sediments), the hy-
                   drosphere (water and ice), the atmosphere (air), and the biosphere (living things, including
                   humans). Within these systems, the location of Earth’s land and water can be described. Also,
                   these systems interact in multiple ways. Weathering and erosion are examples of interactions
                   between Earth’s systems. Some interactions cause landslides, earthquakes, and volcanic erup-
                   tions that impact humans and other organisms. Humans cannot eliminate natural hazards,
                   but solutions can be designed to reduce their impact.

                                    Emphasize most earthquakes and volcanoes occur in bands that are
                                    often along the boundaries between continents and oceans while major
                                    mountain chains may be found inside continents or near their edges.
                                    Examples of data could include maps showing locations of mountains
                                    on continents and the ocean floor or the locations of volcanoes and

 Strand 5.2: PROPERTIES AND CHANGES OF MATTER
All substances are composed of matter. Matter is made of particles that are too small to be
seen but still exist and can be detected by other means. Substances have specific properties
by which they can be identified. When two or more different substances are combined a new
substance with different properties may be formed. Whether a change results in a new sub-
stance or not, the total amount of matter is always conserved.
Standard 5.2.1 Develop and use a model to describe that matter is made of particles
                 on a scale that is too small to be seen. Emphasize making observations of
                 changes supported by a particle model of matter. Examples could include
                 adding air to expand a balloon, compressing air in a syringe, adding food
                 coloring to water, or dissolving salt in water and evaporating the water.

Standard 5.2.2 Ask questions to plan and carry out investigations to identify
                 substances based on patterns of their properties. Emphasize using
                 properties to identify substances. Examples of properties could include
                 color, hardness, conductivity, solubility, or a response to magnetic forces.
                 Examples of substances could include powders, metals, minerals, or
                 liquids. (PS1.A)
Standard 5.2.3 Plan and carry out investigations to determine the effect of combining
                 two or more substances. Emphasize whether a new substance is or is not
                 created by the formation of a new substance with different properties.
                 Examples could include combining vinegar and baking soda or rusting an

                    Strand 5.3: CYCLING OF MATTER IN ECOSYSTEMS
                   Matter cycles within ecosystems and can be traced from organism to organism. Plants use
                   energy from the Sun to change air and water into matter needed for growth. Animals and de-
                   composers consume matter for their life functions, continuing the cycling of matter. Human
                   behavior can affect the cycling of matter. Scientists and engineers design solutions to con-
                   serve Earth’s environments and resources.
                   Standard 5.3.1 Construct an explanation that plants use air, water, and energy
                                    from sunlight to produce plant matter needed for growth. Emphasize
                                    photosynthesis at a conceptual level and that plant matter comes mostly
                                    from air and water, not from the soil. Photosynthesis at the cellular level
                                    will be taught in Grades 6 through 8. (LS1.C)
                   Standard 5.3.2 Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information that animals obtain
                                    energy and matter from the food they eat for body repair, growth, and
                                    motion and to maintain body warmth. Emphasize that the energy used by
                                    animals was once energy from the Sun. Cellular respiration will be taught
                                    in Grades 6 through 8. (PS3.D, LS1.C)
                   Standard 5.3.3 Develop and use a model to describe the movement of matter among
                                    plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment. Emphasize that
                                    matter cycles between the air and soil and among plants, animals, and
                                    microbes as these organisms live and die. Examples could include simple
                                    food chains from ecosystems such as deserts or oceans or diagrams of
                                    decomposers returning matter to the environment. Complex interactions
                                    in a food web will be taught in Grades 6 through 8. (LS2.A, LS2.B)

                                    an optimal solution. Emphasize how humans can balance everyday needs
                                    (agriculture, industry, and energy) while conserving Earth’s environments
                                    and resources. (ESS3.A, ESS3.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

GRADE 6
INTRODUCTION
  The sixth-grade SEEd standards provide a framework for student understanding of the
  cycling of matter and the flow of energy through the study of observable phenomena
  on Earth. Students will explore the role of energy and gravity in the solar system as they
  compare the scale and properties of objects in the solar system and model the Sun-Earth-
  Moon system. These strands also emphasize heat energy as it affects some properties
  of matter, including states of matter and density. The relationship between heat energy
  and matter is observable in many phenomena on Earth, such as seasons, the water cycle,
  weather, and climates. Types of ecosystems on Earth are dependent upon the interaction
  of organisms with each other and with the physical environment. By researching interac-
  tions between the living and nonliving components of ecosystems, students will under-
  stand how the flow of energy and cycling of matter affects stability and change within
  their environment.

                    Strand 6.1: STRUCTURE AND MOTION WITHIN THE SOLAR SYSTEM
                   The solar system consists of the Sun, planets, and other objects within Sun’s gravitational in-
                   fluence. Gravity is the force of attraction between masses. The Sun-Earth-Moon system pro-
                   vides an opportunity to study interactions between objects in the solar system that influence
                   phenomena observed from Earth. Scientists use data from many sources to determine the
                   scale and properties of objects in our solar system.

 Strand 6.2: ENERGY AFFECTS MATTER
Matter and energy are fundamental components of the universe. Matter is anything that has
mass and takes up space. Transfer of energy creates change in matter. Changes between gen-
eral states of matter can occur through the transfer of energy. Density describes how closely
matter is packed together. Substances with a higher density have more matter in a given
space than substances with a lower density. Changes in heat energy can alter the density of
a material. Insulators resist the transfer of heat energy, while conductors easily transfer heat
energy. These differences in energy flow can be used to design products to meet the needs of
society.
Standard 6.2.1 Develop models to show that molecules are made of different kinds,
                 proportions, and quantities of atoms. Emphasize understanding that
                 there are differences between atoms and molecules, and that certain
                 combinations of atoms form specific molecules. Examples of simple
                 molecules could include water (H2O), atmospheric oxygen (O2), or carbon
                 dioxide (CO2). (PS1.A)
Standard 6.2.2 Develop a model to predict the effect of heat energy on states of matter
                 and density. Emphasize the arrangement of particles in states of matter
                 (solid, liquid, or gas) and during phase changes (melting, freezing,
                 condensing, and evaporating). (PS1.A, PS3.A)
Standard 6.2.3 Plan and carry out an investigation to determine the relationship
                 between temperature, the amount of heat transferred, and the change of

                 recording and evaluating data, and communicating the results of the
                 investigation. (PS3.A)
Standard 6.2.4 Design an object, tool, or process that minimizes or maximizes heat energy
                 transfer. Identify criteria and constraints, develop a prototype for iterative
                 testing, analyze data from testing, and propose modifications for optimizing
                 the design solution. Emphasize demonstrating how the structure of
                 differing materials allows them to function as either conductors or
                 insulators. (PS3.A, PS3.B, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)

                   All Earth processes are the result of energy flowing and matter cycling within and among the
                   planet’s systems. Heat energy from the Sun, transmitted by radiation, is the primary source of
                   energy that affects Earth’s weather and drives the water cycle. Uneven heating across Earth’s
                   surface causes changes in density, which result in convection currents in water and air, cre-
                   ating patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that determine regional and global
                   climates.

                                    for how air masses flow from regions of high pressure to low pressure
                                    causing a change in weather. Examples of data collection could include
                                    field observations, laboratory experiments, weather maps, or diagrams.

 Strand 6.4: STABILITY AND CHANGE IN ECOSYSTEMS
The study of ecosystems includes the interaction of organisms with each other and with the
physical environment. Consistent interactions occur within and between species in various
ecosystems as organisms obtain resources, change the environment, and are affected by the
environment. This influences the flow of energy through an ecosystem, resulting in system
variations. Additionally, ecosystems benefit humans through processes and resources, such as
the production of food, water and air purification, and recreation opportunities. Scientists and
engineers investigate interactions among organisms and evaluate design solutions to pre-
serve biodiversity and ecosystem resources.
Standard 6.4.1 Analyze data to provide evidence for the effects of resource availability
                 on organisms and populations in an ecosystem. Ask questions to
                 predict how changes in resource availability affects organisms in those
                 ecosystems. Examples could include water, food, or living space in Utah
                 environments. (LS2.A)
Standard 6.4.2 Construct an explanation that predicts patterns of interactions among
                 organisms across multiple ecosystems. Emphasize consistent interactions
                 in different environments such as competition, predation, and mutualism.

Standard 6.4.3 Develop a model to describe the cycling of matter and flow of energy
                 among living and nonliving parts of an ecosystem. Emphasize food
                 webs and the role of producers, consumers, and decomposers in various
                 ecosystems. Examples could include Utah ecosystems such as mountains,
                 Great Salt Lake, wetlands, or deserts. (LS2.B)

INTRODUCTION
  The seventh-grade SEEd standards look for relationships of cause and effect which enable
  students to pinpoint mechanisms of nature and allow them to make predictions. Students
  will explore how forces can cause changes in motion and are responsible for the transfer
  of energy and the cycling of matter. This takes place within and between a wide variety of
  systems from simple, short-term forces on individual objects to the deep, long-term forces
  that shape our planet. In turn, Earth’s environments provide the conditions for life as we
  know it. Organisms survive and reproduce only to the extent that their own mechanisms
  and adaptations allow. Evidence for the evolutionary histories of life on Earth is provided
  through the fossil record, similarities in the various structures among species, organism
  development, and genetic similarities across all organisms. Additionally, mechanisms
  shaping Earth are understood as forces affecting the cycling of Earth’s materials. Questions
  about cause and effect and the ongoing search for evidence in science, or science’s ongo-
  ing search for evidence, drive this storyline.

                    Strand 7.1: FORCES ARE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MATTER
                   Forces are push or pull interactions between two objects. Changes in motion, balance and
                   stability, and transfers of energy are all facilitated by forces on matter. Forces, including elec-
                   tric, magnetic, and gravitational forces, can act on objects that are not in contact with each
                   other. Scientists use data from many sources to examine the cause and effect relationships de-
                   termined by different forces.
                   Standard 7.1.1 Carry out an investigation which provides evidence that a change in an
                                    object’s motion is dependent on the mass of the object and the sum of
                                    the forces acting on it. Various experimental designs should be evaluated
                                    to determine how well the investigation measures an object’s motion.
                                    Emphasize conceptual understanding of Newton’s First and Second Laws.
                                    Calculations will only focus on one-dimensional movement; the use of
                                    vectors will be introduced in high school. (PS2.A, PS2.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B,

                                    include the effect of the number of turns of wire on the strength of an

 Strand 7.2: CHANGES TO EARTH OVER TIME
Earth’s processes are dynamic and interactive and are the result of energy flowing and mat-
ter cycling within and among Earth’s systems. Energy from the sun and Earth’s internal heat
are the main sources driving these processes. Plate tectonics is a unifying theory that explains
crustal movements of Earth’s surface, how and where different rocks form, the occurrence of
earthquakes and volcanoes, and the distribution of fossil plants and animals.
Standard 7.2.1 Develop a model of the rock cycle to describe the relationship between
                 energy flow and matter cycling that create igneous, sedimentary, and
                 metamorphic rocks. Emphasize the processes of melting, crystallization,
                 weathering, deposition, sedimentation, and deformation, which act
                 together to form minerals and rocks. (ESS1.C, ESS2.A)
Standard 7.2.2 Construct an explanation based on evidence for how processes have
                 changed Earth’s surface at varying time and spatial scales. Examples
                 of processes that occur at varying time scales could include slow plate
                 motions or rapid landslides. Examples of processes that occur at varying
                 spatial scales could include uplift of a mountain range or deposition of
                 fine sediments. (ESS2.A, ESS2.C)
Standard 7.2.3 Ask questions to identify constraints of specific geologic hazards and
                 evaluate competing design solutions for maintaining the stability of human-
                 engineered structures, such as homes, roads, and bridges. Examples of
                 geologic hazards could include earthquakes, landslides, or floods. (ESS2.A,
                 ESS2.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)
Standard 7.2.4 Develop and use a scale model of the matter in the Earth’s interior
                 to demonstrate how differences in density and chemical composition
                 (silicon, oxygen, iron, and magnesium) cause the formation of the crust,
                 mantle, and core. (ESS2.A)
Standard 7.2.5 Ask questions and analyze and interpret data about the patterns
                 between plate tectonics and:

                 (2) Continental and ocean floor features.
                 (3) The distribution of rocks and fossils.
                    Examples could include identifying patterns on maps of earthquakes and
                    volcanoes relative to plate boundaries, the shapes of the continents, the
                    locations of ocean structures (including mountains, volcanoes, faults, and
                    trenches), or similarities of rock and fossil types on different continents.

                   Living things are made of smaller structures, which function to meet the needs of survival. The
                   basic structural unit of all living things is the cell. Parts of a cell work together to function as a
                   system. Cells work together and form tissues, organs, and organ systems. Organ systems inter-
                   act to meet the needs of the organism.

                                    single-celled or multicellular organisms, and multicellular organisms are
                                    made of different types of cells. (LS1.A)

 Strand 7.4: REPRODUCTION AND INHERITANCE
The great diversity of species on Earth is a result of genetic variation. Genetic traits are passed
from parent to offspring. These traits affect the structure and behavior of organisms, which af-
fect the organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. Mutations can cause changes in traits that
may affect an organism. As technology has developed, humans have been able to change the
inherited traits in organisms, which may have an impact on society.
Standard 7.4.1 Develop and use a model to explain the effects that different types of
                 reproduction have on genetic variation. Emphasize genetic variation
                 through asexual and sexual reproduction. (LS1.B, LS3.A, LS3.B)
Standard 7.4.2 Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information about specific
                 animal and plant adaptations and structures that affect the probability

                 building to protect young from the cold, herding of animals to protect
                 young from predators, vocalization of animals and colorful plumage
                 to attract mates for breeding, bright flowers attracting butterflies that
                 transfer pollen, flower nectar and odors that attract insects that transfer
                 pollen, or hard shells on nuts that squirrels bury. (LS1.B)
Standard 7.4.3 Develop and use a model to describe why genetic mutations may result
                 in harmful, beneficial, or neutral effects to the structure and function of

                 happen because of genetic mutations. Specific changes of genes at the
                 molecular level, mechanisms for protein synthesis, and specific types of

INTRODUCTION
  The eighth-grade SEEd standards describe the constant interaction of matter and energy
  in nature. Students will explore how matter is arranged into either simple or complex sub-
  stances. The strands emphasize how substances store and transfer energy which can cause
  them to interact physically and chemically, provide energy to living organisms, or be har-
  nessed and used by humans. Matter and energy cycle and change in ecosystems through
  processes that occur during photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Additionally, substanc-
  es that provide a benefit to organisms, including humans, are unevenly distributed on Earth
  due to geologic and atmospheric systems. Some resources form quickly, allowing them to
  be renewable, while other resources are nonrenewable. Evidence reveals that Earth’s sys-
  tems change and affect ecosystems and organisms in positive and negative ways.

                    Strand 8.1: MATTER AND ENERGY INTERACT IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD
                   The physical world is made of atoms and molecules. Even large objects can be viewed as a
                   combination of small particles. Energy causes particles to move and interact physically or
                   chemically. Those interactions create a variety of substances. As molecules undergo a chemi-
                   cal or physical change, the number of atoms in that system remains constant. Humans use en-
                   ergy to refine natural resources into synthetic materials.

 Strand 8.2: ENERGY IS STORED AND TRANSFERRED IN PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
Objects can store and transfer energy within systems. Energy can be transferred between ob-
jects, which involves changes in the object’s energy. There is a direct relationship between an
object’s energy, mass, and velocity. Energy can travel in waves and may be harnessed to transmit
information.
Standard 8.2.1 Use computational thinking to analyze data about the relationship
                 between the mass and speed of objects and the relative amount of kinetic
                 energy of the objects. Emphasis should be on the quantity of mass and
                 relative speed to the observable effects of the kinetic energy. Examples
                 could include a full cart vs. an empty cart or rolling spheres with different
                 masses down a ramp to measure the effects on stationary masses.
                 Calculations of kinetic and potential energy will be learned at the high
                 school level. (PS3.A)
Standard 8.2.2 Ask questions about how the amount of potential energy varies as dis-
                 tance within the system changes. Plan and conduct an investigation to
                 answer a question about potential energy. Emphasize comparing relative
                 amounts of energy. Examples could include a cart at varying positions on
                 a hill or an object being dropped from different heights. Calculations of
                 kinetic and potential energy will be learned at the high school level. (PS3.A,
                 PS3.C)
Standard 8.2.3 Engage in argument to identify the strongest evidence that supports the
                 claim that the kinetic energy of an object changes as energy is transferred to
                 or from the object. Examples could include observing temperature changes
                 as a result of friction, applying force to an object, or releasing potential en-
                 ergy from an object. (PS3.A, PS3.B)
Standard 8.2.4 Use computational thinking to describe a simple model for waves that
                 shows the pattern of wave amplitude being related to wave energy.
                 Emphasize describing waves with both quantitative and qualitative
                 thinking. Examples could include using graphs, charts, computer
                 simulations, or physical models to demonstrate amplitude and energy
                 correlation. (PS4.A)
Standard 8.2.5 Develop and use a model to describe the structure of waves and how
                 they are reflected, absorbed, or transmitted through various materials.
                 Emphasize both light and mechanical waves. Examples could include
                 drawings, simulations, or written descriptions of light waves through a
                 prism; mechanical waves through gas vs. liquids vs. solids; or sound waves
                 through different mediums. (PS4.A, PS4.B)
Standard 8.2.6 Obtain and evaluate information to communicate the claim that the
                 structure of digital signals are a more reliable way to store or transmit
                                                                                                    GRADE 8 | 63
                 information than analog signals. Emphasize the basic understanding that
                 waves can be used for communication purposes. Examples could include
                 using vinyl record vs. digital song files, film cameras vs. digital cameras, or
                 alcohol thermometers vs. digital thermometers. (PS4.C)

                    Strand 8.3: LIFE SYSTEMS STORE AND TRANSFER MATTER AND ENERGY
                   Living things use energy from their environment to rearrange matter to sustain life.
                   Photosynthetic organisms are able to transfer light energy to chemical energy. Consumers can
                   break down complex food molecules to utilize the stored energy and use the particles to form
                   new, life-sustaining molecules. Ecosystems are examples of how energy can flow while matter
                   cycles through the living and nonliving components of systems.
                   Standard 8.3.1 Plan and conduct an investigation and use the evidence to construct
                                    an explanation of how photosynthetic organisms use energy to
                                    transform matter. Emphasize molecular and energy transformations
                                    during photosynthesis. (PS3.D, LS1.C)
                   Standard 8.3.2 Develop a model to describe how food is changed through chemical
                                    reactions to form new molecules that support growth and/or release
                                    energy as matter cycles through an organism. Emphasize describing that
                                    during cellular respiration molecules are broken apart and rearranged
                                    into new molecules, and that this process releases energy. (PS3.D, LS1.C)
                   Standard 8.3.3 Ask questions to obtain, evaluate, and communicate information
                                    about how changes to an ecosystem affect the stability of cycling matter
                                    and the flow of energy among living and nonliving parts of an ecosystem.
                                    Emphasize describing the cycling of matter and flow of energy through

 Strand 8.4: INTERACTIONS WITH NATURAL SYSTEMS AND RESOURCES
Interactions of matter and energy through geologic processes have led to the uneven distri-
bution of natural resources. Many of these resources are nonrenewable, and per-capita use
can cause positive or negative consequences. Global temperatures change due to various fac-
tors, and can cause a change in regional climates. As energy flows through the physical world,
natural disasters can occur that affect human life. Humans can study patterns in natural sys-
tems to anticipate and forecast some future disasters and work to mitigate the outcomes.
Standard 8.4.1 Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence that shows that the
                 uneven distribution of Earth’s mineral, energy, and groundwater resources
                 is caused by geological processes. Examples of uneven distribution of
                 resources could include Utah’s unique geologic history that led to the
                 formation and irregular distribution of natural resources like copper, gold,
                 natural gas, oil shale, silver, or uranium. (ESS3.A)
Standard 8.4.2 Engage in argument supported by evidence about the effect of per-
                 capita consumption of natural resources on Earth’s systems. Emphasize
                 that these resources are limited and may be non-renewable. Examples of
                 evidence include rates of consumption of food and natural resources such
                 as freshwater, minerals, or energy sources. (ESS3.A, ESS3.C)
Standard 8.4.3 Design a solution to monitor or mitigate the potential effects of the
                 use of natural resources. Evaluate competing design solutions using a
                 systematic process to determine how well each solution meets the criteria and
                 constraints of the problem. Examples of uses of the natural environment
                 could include agriculture, conservation efforts, recreation, solar energy, or
                 water management. (ESS3.A, ESS3.C, ETS1.A, ETS1.B, ETS1.C)
Standard 8.4.4 Analyze and interpret data on the factors that change global
                 temperatures and their effects on regional climates. Examples of factors
                 could include agricultural activity, changes in solar radiation, fossil fuel
                 use, or volcanic activity. Examples of data could include graphs of the
                 atmospheric levels of gases, seawater levels, ice cap coverage, human
                 activities, or maps of global and regional temperatures. (ESS3.D)
Standard 8.4.5 Analyze and interpret patterns of the occurrence of natural hazards
                 to forecast future catastrophic events, and investigate how data are
                 used to develop technologies to mitigate their effects. Emphasize how
                 some natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions and severe weather,
                 are preceded by phenomena that allow prediction, but others, such as
                 earthquakes, may occur without warning. (ESS3.B)

INTRODUCTION
  The biology SEEd standards explore the patterns, processes, relationships, and the envi-
  ronments of living organisms. Students analyze data on the role of matter cycles and ener-
  gy flow when organisms interact with their environment to explain how the stability and
  change of an ecosystem and biodiversity can be affected. Students investigate the struc-
  tures and functions of living organisms needed in order to support necessary life func-
  tions. Students explore the cause and effect relationships of heredity, the role of DNA in
  gene expression and protein synthesis, and how gene expression can be altered by envi-
  ronmental and genetic causes. Students investigate how the mechanisms of genetic varia-
  tion can lead to diversity within and among species and explain how the unity among
  species as well as the great diversity of species is a result of evolution by natural selection.
  Additionally, students design and evaluate solutions to problems that exist in these areas.

                   The cycling of matter and flow of energy are part of a complex system of interactions within
                   an ecosystem. Through these interactions, an ecosystem can sustain relatively stable numbers
                   and types of organisms. A stable ecosystem is capable of recovering from moderate biological
                   and physical changes. Extreme changes may have significant impact on an ecosystem’s carry-
                   ing capacity and biodiversity, altering the ecosystem. Human activities can lead to significant
                   impacts on an ecosystem.

 Strand BIO.2: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF LIFE
Living cells are composed of chemical elements and molecules that form macromolecules.
The macromolecules in a cell function to carry out important reactions that allow cycling of
matter and flow of energy within and between organisms. All organisms are made of one
or more cells. The structure and function of a cell determines the cell’s role in an organism.
Multicellular organisms have systems of tissues and organs that work together to meet the
needs of the whole organism. Cells grow, divide, and function in order to accomplish essential
life processes. Feedback systems help organisms maintain homeostasis.
Standard BIO.2.1     Construct an explanation based on evidence that all organisms

 Strand BIO.3: GENETIC PATTERNS
Heredity is a unifying biological principle that explains how information is passed from par-
ent to offspring through deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules in the form of chromosomes.
Distinct sequences of DNA, called genes, carry the code for specific proteins, which are re-
sponsible for the specific traits and life functions of organisms. There are predictable patterns
of inheritance; however, changes in the DNA sequence and environmental factors may alter
genetic expression. The variation and distribution of traits observed in a population depend
on both genetic and environmental factors. Research in the field of heredity has led to the de-
velopment of multiple genetic technologies that may improve the quality of life but may also
raise ethical issues.
Standard BIO.3.1      Construct an explanation for how the structure of DNA is replicated,
                        and how DNA and RNA code for the structure of proteins which
                        regulate and carry out the essential functions of life and result in
                        specific traits. Emphasize a conceptual understanding that the
                        sequence of nucleotides in DNA determines the amino acid sequence
                        of proteins through the processes of transcription and translation.

                        inheritance patterns can be predicted by observing the way genes
                        are expressed. Examples of tools to make predictions could include
                        Punnett squares, pedigrees, or karyotypes. Examples of allele crosses
                        could include dominant/recessive, incomplete dominant, codominant,

                        the expression of those traits. Examples of variation and patterns in
                        distribution of traits could include sickle-cell anemia and malaria,
                        hemoglobin levels in humans at high elevation, or antibiotic

                   The unity among species, as evidenced in the fossil record, similarities in DNA and other bio-
                   molecules, anatomical structures, and embryonic development, is the result of evolution.
                   Evolution also explains the diversity within and among species. Evolution by natural selection
                   is the result of environmental factors selecting for and against genetic traits. Traits that allow
                   an individual to survive and reproduce are likely to increase in the next generation, causing
                   the proportions of specific traits to change within a population. Over longer periods of time,
                   changes in proportions of traits due to natural selection and changes in selective pressures
                   can cause both speciation and extinction. Changes in environmental conditions impact biodi-

INTRODUCTION
  The chemistry SEEd standards explore the foundational principles of chemistry that allow
  students to investigate the ways in which chemistry impacts everyday life. Students inves-
  tigate the properties and structure of matter at atomic and subatomic scales to explain
  how they influence a system’s larger scale, structures, properties, and functions. Students
  explain how macroscopic observations are translated into molecular-level representations
  and then develop and use these models to describe molecules with chemical equations
  or mathematical expressions. Students analyze data on the relationships between atomic
  and molecular structures and the properties of materials that are observed macroscopi-
  cally using the human senses and scientific instruments. Students explain that matter is
  conserved in chemical reactions and nutrient cycles, the ability of humans to design and
  control chemical systems for the benefit of society, and the ways that energy interacts with
  matter. Additionally, students design and evaluate solutions to problems that exist in these
  areas.

Strand CHEM.2: THE STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF MOLECULES
Electrical attractions and repulsions between charged particles (atomic nuclei and electrons)
in matter explain the structure of atoms and the forces between atoms that cause them to
form molecules via chemical bonds. Molecules can range in size from two atoms to thousands
of atoms. The same forces cause atoms to combine to form extended structures, such as crys-
tals or metals. The varied properties of the materials, both natural and manufactured, can
be understood in terms of the atomic and molecular particles present and the forces within
and between them. Materials are engineered to fulfill a desired function or role with desired
properties.
Standard CHEM.2.1 Analyze data to predict the type of bonding most likely to occur
                    between two elements using the patterns of reactivity on the
                    periodic table. Emphasize the types and strengths of attractions
                    between charged particles in ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds.
                    Examples could include the attraction between electrons on one
                    atom and the nucleus of another atom in a covalent bond or
                    between ions in an ionic compound. (PS1.A, PS2.B)
Standard CHEM.2.2 Plan and carry out an investigation to compare the properties of
                    substances at the bulk scale and relate them to molecular structures.
                    Emphasize using models to explain or describe the strength of
                    electrical forces between particles. Examples of models could
                    include Lewis dot structures or ball and stick models. Examples
                    of particles could include ions, atoms, molecules, or networked
                    materials (such as graphite). Examples of properties could include
                    melting point and boiling point, vapor pressure, solubility, or surface
                    tension. (PS1.A)
Standard CHEM.2.3 Engage in argument supported by evidence that the functions of
                    natural and designed macromolecules are related to their chemical
                    structures. Emphasize the roles of attractive forces between and
                    within molecules. Examples could include non-covalent interactions
                    between base pairs in DNA allowing it to be unzipped for replication,
                    the network of atoms in a diamond conferring hardness, or the
                    nonpolar nature of polyester (PET) making it quick-drying. (PS1.A)
Standard CHEM.2.4 Evaluate design solutions where synthetic chemistry was used to
                    solve a problem (cause and effect). Define the problem, identify criteria
                    and constraints, analyze available data on proposed solutions, and
                    determine an optimal solution. Emphasize the design of materials to
                    control their properties through chemistry. Examples could include
                    pharmaceuticals that target active sites, teflon to reduce friction
                    on surfaces, or nanoparticles of zinc oxide to create transparent

                      Strand CHEM.3: STABILITY AND CHANGE IN CHEMICAL SYSTEMS
                     Conservation of matter describes the cycling of matter and the use of resources. In both
                     chemical and physical changes, the total number of each type of atom is conserved. When
                     substances are combined, they may interact with each other to form a solution. The propor-
                     tion of substances in a solution can be represented with concentration. In a chemical change,
                     the atoms are rearranged by breaking and forming bonds to create different molecules, which
                     may have different properties. Chemical processes can be understood in terms of the colli-
                     sions of molecules and the rearrangements of atoms. The rate at which chemical processes
                     occur can be modified. In many situations, a dynamic and condition-dependent balance be-
                     tween a reaction and the reverse reaction determines the numbers of all types of molecules
                     present. Chemists can control and design chemical systems to create desirable results, al-
                     though sometimes there are also unintended consequences.
                     Standard CHEM.3.1 Use mathematics and computational thinking to analyze the

                                         properties, rather than algorithmic calculations. Examples of
                                         concentrations affecting solutions could include the Beer-Lambert
                                         Law, colligative properties, or pH. (PS1.A)

                                         in bonds and the symbolic notation used in chemistry. Emphasize
                                         that the visible macroscopic changes in chemical reactions are a

                                         and matter cycles. Emphasize that chemical reactions occur on
                                         both small and global scales, and that matter is always conserved.
                                         Examples of small scale reactions could include ratios of reactants

                      Strand CHEM.4: ENERGY IN CHEMICAL SYSTEMS
                     A system’s total energy is conserved as energy is continually transferred from one particle to
                     another and between its various possible forms. The energy of a system depends on the mo-
                     tion and interactions of matter and radiation within that system. When bonds are formed
                     between atoms, energy is released. Energy must be provided when bonds are broken. When
                     electromagnetic radiation with longer wavelengths is absorbed by matter, it is generally con-
                     verted into thermal energy or heat. When visible light is absorbed by matter, it results in phe-
                     nomena related to color. When shorter wavelength electromagnetic radiation is absorbed
                     by matter, it can ionize atoms and cause damage to living cells. Nuclear processes, including
                     fusion, fission, and radioactive decays of unstable nuclei, involve the release or absorption of
                     large amounts of energy. Society’s demand for energy requires thinking creatively about ways
                     to provide energy that don’t deplete limited resources or produce harmful emissions.
                     Standard CHEM.4.1 Construct an argument from evidence about whether a simple
                                         chemical reaction absorbs or releases energy. Emphasize that the
                                         overall change in energy is related to the energy absorbed when
                                         bonds are broken and the energy released when bonds are formed.

 Strand ESS.2: PATTERNS IN EARTH’S HISTORY AND PROCESSES
Although active geologic processes have destroyed or altered most of Earth’s early rock re-
cord, evidence from within Earth and from other objects in the solar system are used to infer
Earth’s geologic history. Motions of the mantle and its plates occur primarily through ther-
mal convection, which involves the cycling of matter due to the outward flow of energy from
Earth’s interior and gravitational movement of denser materials toward the interior. The radio-
active decay of unstable isotopes continually generates new energy within Earth’s crust and
mantle, providing the primary source of the heat that drives mantle convection. Plate tecton-
ics is the unifying theory that explains the past and current movements of the rocks at Earth’s
surface and provides a framework for understanding its geologic history and co-evolution of
life.

The abundance of liquid water on Earth’s surface and its unique properties are central to the
planet’s dynamics and system interactions. The foundation for Earth’s global weather and cli-
mate systems is electromagnetic radiation from the Sun. The ocean exerts a major influence
on weather and climate by absorbing energy from the Sun, releasing it over time, and globally
redistributing it through ocean currents. Changes in the atmosphere due to human activity
increase carbon dioxide concentrations and thus affect climate. Current scientific models pre-
dict that future average global temperatures will continue to rise, although regional climate
changes will be complex and varied.

is constantly changing due to societal needs. Natural hazards and other geologic events have
shaped the course of human history. The sustainability of human societies, and the biodiver-
sity that supports them, requires responsible management of natural resources. Scientists and
engineers can make major contributions by developing technologies that produce less pollu-

INTRODUCTION
  The physics SEEd standards explore the foundational principles of physics including
  forces, energy, fields, and waves. Students analyze and interpret data to determine the
  cause and effect relationship between the net force of an object and its change in mo-
  tion. Students develop and use models to illustrate that energy at all levels can be ac-
  counted for as a combination of energies associated with motion and relative positions
  of objects. Students use mathematics and computational thinking to support the claim
  that the total momentum of a system is conserved when there is no net force acting on a
  system. Students plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that an electric cur-
  rent causes a magnetic field and that a changing magnetic field causes an electric current.
  Students also engage in argument to support the assertion that electromagnetic radiation
  can be described either by a wave or a particle model. Additionally, students design and
  evaluate solutions to problems that exist in these areas.

                    Strand PHYS.1: FORCES AND INTERACTIONS
                   Uniform motion of an object is natural. Changes in motion are caused by a nonzero sum of
                   forces. A “net force” causes an acceleration as predicted by Newton’s 2nd Law. Qualitative and
                   quantitative analysis of position, velocity, and acceleration provide evidence of the effects of
                   forces. Momentum is defined for a particular frame of reference; it is the product of the mass
                   and the velocity of the object. In any system, total momentum is always conserved. If a system
                   interacts with objects outside itself, the total momentum of the system can change; however,
                   any such change is balanced by changes in the momentum of objects outside the system. The
                   time over which these paired forces are exerted determines the impact force.

                                            subject to a net unbalanced force, such as a falling object, an object
                                            sliding down a ramp, or a moving object being pulled by a constant

 Strand PHYS.2: ENERGY
Energy describes the motion and interactions of matter and radiation within a system. Energy
is a quantifiable property that is conserved in isolated systems and in the universe as a whole.
At the macroscopic scale, energy manifests itself in multiple ways such as in motion, sound,
light, and thermal energy. Uncontrolled systems always evolve toward more stable states—
that is, toward more uniform energy distribution. Examining the world through an energy lens
allows us to model and predict complex interactions of multiple objects within a system and
address societal needs.
Standard PHYS.2.1      Analyze and interpret data to track and calculate the transfer
                         of energy within a system. Emphasize the identification of the
                         components of the system, along with their initial and final energies,
                         and mathematical descriptions to depict energy transfer in the
                         system. Examples of energy transfer could include the transfer of
                         energy during a collision or heat transfer. (PS3.A, PS3.B)
Standard PHYS.2.2      Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that the
                         transfer of thermal energy when two components of different
                         temperature are combined within a closed system results in a more
                         uniform energy distribution among the components in the system.
                         Emphasize that uniform distribution of energy is a natural tendency.
                         Examples could include the measurement of the reduction of
                         temperature of a hot object or the increase in temperature of a cold
                         object. (PS3.B)
Standard PHYS.2.3      Develop and use models on the macroscopic scale to illustrate that
                         energy can be accounted for as a combination of energies associated

                         of the model to show that energy is conserved. Examples could
                         include mechanical systems where kinetic energy is transformed to

 Strand PHYS.3: FIELDS
Fields describe how forces act through space and how potential energy is stored in systems.
These take on different forms of electric, magnetic, or gravitational fields, but similarly provide
a mechanism for how matter interacts. When two objects interacting through a field change
relative position, the energy stored in the field is changed. These fields are important at a wide
variety of scales, ranging from the subatomic to the astronomic.
Standard PHYS.3.1       Use mathematics and computational thinking to compare

                          comparative strength of these two field forces, the effect of distance
                          between interacting objects on the magnitudes of these forces, and
                          the use of models to understand field forces. (PS2.B)
Standard PHYS.3.2       Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that
                          an electric current causes a magnetic field and that a changing
                          magnetic field causes an electric current. Emphasize the qualitative
                          relationship between electricity and magnetism without necessarily
                          conducting quantitative analysis. Examples could include

                          charged particles in electric fields and masses in gravitational fields.
                          Examples could include models, simulations, or experiments that

                    Strand PHYS.4: WAVES
                   Waves transfer energy through oscillations of fields or matter. The wavelength and frequency
                   of a wave are related to one another by the speed of travel of the wave, which depends on the
                   type of wave and the medium through which it passes. Waves produce interference as they
                   overlap but they emerge unaffected by each other. The wave model is useful for explaining
                   many features of electromagnetic radiation, and the particle model explains other features.
                   Electromagnetic radiation can be modeled as a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields
                   or as particles called photons. When light or longer wavelength electromagnetic radiation
                   is absorbed in matter, it is generally converted into thermal energy. Because waves depend
                   upon the properties of fields and the predictable transformation of energy, they can be used
                   to interpret the nature of matter and its energy. Waves are utilized to transmit information
                   both in analog and digital forms.
