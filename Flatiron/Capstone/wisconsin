Foreword
On November 13, 2017, I formally adopted the Wisconsin Standards for Science. This revised set of
academic standards provides a foundational framework that identifies what students should know and
be able to do in Science.
The adoption of the Wisconsin Standards for Science was part of a concerted effort led by Wisconsin
educators and stakeholders who shared their expertise in science and teaching from kindergarten
through higher education. The public and legislature provided feedback for the writing committee to
consider as part of Wisconsin’s Academic Standards review and revision process.
Science is an essential part of a comprehensive PK-12 education for all students. The knowledge, techniques, and citizenry skills
gained through science education in Wisconsin schools support the overall goal of helping all students become college and
career ready. Scientific literacy is a critical elementary of being able to make sense of the world around us, including the
abundant information shared in our ever-changing world.
The knowledge and skills described provide a framework with actionable indicators for science classroom experiences. The key
goal of the standards is for students make sense of phenomena and solve problems using scientific content understanding,
practices, and ways of thinking. Teaching content for the purpose of “covering” a set range of topics is not the intent of these
standards; instead, as research suggests, students should be learning scientific ideas through deeply exploring scientific
phenomena and solving culturally relevant, local problems.
The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction will continue to build on this work to support implementation of the standards
with resources for the field. I am excited to share the Wisconsin Standards for Science, which aim to build science skills, knowledge,
ways of thinking, and engagement opportunities for all Wisconsin students.

Wisconsin’s Approach to Academic Standards


Purpose of the Document
The purpose of this guide is to improve science education for students and for communities. The Wisconsin Department of Public
Instruction (DPI) has developed standards to assist Wisconsin educators and stakeholders in understanding, developing and
implementing science course offerings and curriculum in school districts across Wisconsin.
This publication provides a vision for student success and follows The Guiding Principles for Teaching and Learning (2011). In brief,
the principles are:
    1. Every student has the right to learn.
    2. Instruction must be rigorous and relevant.
    3. Purposeful assessment drives instruction and affects learning.
    4. Learning is a collaborative responsibility.
    5. Students bring strengths and experiences to learning.
    6. Responsive environments engage learners.
Program leaders will find the guide valuable for making decisions about:
    • Program structure and integration
    • Curriculum redesign
    • Staffing and staff development
    • Scheduling and student grouping
    • Facility organization
    • Learning spaces and materials development
    • Resource allocation and accountability
    • Collaborative work with other units of the school, district and community

What Are the Academic Standards?
Wisconsin Academic Standards specify what students should know and be able to do in the classroom. They serve as goals for
teaching and learning. Setting high standards enables students, parents, educators, and citizens to know what students should
have learned at a given point in time. In Wisconsin, all state standards serve as a model. Locally elected school boards adopt
academic standards in each subject area to best serve their local communities. We must ensure that all children have equal
access to high-quality education programs. Clear statements about what students must know and be able to do are essential in
making sure our schools offer opportunities to get the knowledge and skills necessary for success beyond the classroom.
Adopting these standards is voluntary. Districts may use the academic standards as guides for developing local grade-by-grade
level curriculum. Implementing standards may require some school districts to upgrade school and district curriculums. This may
result in changes in instructional methods and materials, local assessments, and professional development opportunities for the
teaching and administrative staff.
What is the Difference between Academic Standards and Curriculum?
Standards are statements about what students should know and be able to do, what they might be asked to do to give evidence
of learning, and how well they should be expected to know or do it. Curriculum is the program devised by local school districts
used to prepare students to meet standards. It consists of activities and lessons at each grade level, instructional materials, and
various instructional techniques. In short, standards define what is to be learned at certain points in time, and from a broad
perspective, what performances will be accepted as evidence that the learning has occurred. Curriculum specifies the details of
the day-to-day schooling at the local level.
Developing the Academic Standards
DPI has a transparent and comprehensive process for reviewing and revising academic standards. The process begins with a
notice of intent to review an academic area with a public comment period. The State Superintendent’s Standards Review Council
examines those comments and may recommend revision or development of standards in that academic area. The state
superintendent authorizes whether or not to pursue a revision or development process. Following this, a state writing
committee is formed to work on those standards for all grade levels. That draft is then made available for open review to get
feedback from the public, key stakeholders, educators, and the Legislature with further review by the State Superintendent’s
Standards Review Council. The state superintendent then determines adoption of the standards.

Aligning for Student Success
To build and sustain schools that support every student in achieving success, educators must work together with families,
community members, and business partners to connect the most promising practices to the most meaningful contexts. The
release of the Wisconsin Standards for Science provides a set of important academic standards for school districts to implement.
This is connected to a larger vision of every child graduating college, career, and community ready. The graphic below illustrates
the relationship between academic standards and other critical principles and efforts that function together to educate every
child to graduate future ready. Here, the vision and set of Guiding Principles form the foundation for building a supportive
process for teaching and learning rigorous and relevant content. The following sections articulate this integrated approach to
increasing student success in Wisconsin schools and communities.
Relating the Academic Standards to All Students
Grade-level standards should allow ALL students to engage, access, and be assessed in ways that fit their strengths, needs, and
interests. This applies to the achievement of students with IEPs (individualized education plans), English learners, and gifted and
talented pupils, consistent with all other students. Academic standards serve as the foundation for individualized programming
decisions for all students.
Academic standards serve as a valuable basis for establishing concrete, meaningful goals as part of each student’s developmental
progress and demonstration of proficiency. Students with IEPs must be provided specially designed instruction that meets their
individual needs. It is expected that each individual student with an IEP will require unique services and supports matched to
their strengths and needs in order to close achievement gaps in grade-level standards. Alternate standards are only available for
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.
Gifted and talented students may achieve well beyond the academic standards and move into advanced grade levels or into
advanced coursework.
Our Vision: Every Child a Graduate, College and Career Ready
We are committed to ensuring every child graduates from high school academically prepared and socially and emotionally
competent. A successful Wisconsin student is proficient in academic content and can apply their knowledge through skills such
as critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. The successful student will also possess critical habits such as
perseverance, responsibility, adaptability, and leadership. This vision for every child as a college, career, and community ready
graduate guides our beliefs and approaches to education in Wisconsin.
Wisconsin Standards for Science                                                                                                      4


Guided by Principles
All educational initiatives are guided and impacted by important and often unstated attitudes or principles for teaching and
learning. The Guiding Principles for Teaching and Learning (2011) emerge from research and provide the touchstone for practices
that truly affect the vision of Every Child a Graduate Prepared for College and Career. When made transparent, these principles
inform what happens in the classroom, direct the implementation and evaluation of programs, and most importantly, remind us
of our own beliefs and expectations for students.
Ensuring a Process for Student Success
For Wisconsin schools and districts, implementing the Framework for
Equitable Multi-Level Systems of Supports (2017) means providing equitable
services, practices, and resources to every learner based upon
responsiveness to effective instruction and intervention. In this system,
high-quality instruction, strategic use of data, and collaboration interact
within a continuum of supports to facilitate learner success. Schools provide
varying types of supports with differing levels of intensity to proactively
and responsibly adjust to the needs of the whole child. These include the
knowledge, skills, and habits learners need for success beyond high school,
including developmental, academic, behavioral, social, and emotional skills.
Connecting to Content: Wisconsin Academic Standards
Within this vision for increased student success, rigorous, internationally
benchmarked academic standards provide the content for high-quality
curriculum and instruction and for a strategic assessment system aligned to those standards. With the adoption of the standards,
Wisconsin has the tools to design curriculum, instruction, and assessments to maximize student learning. The standards
articulate what we teach so that educators can focus on how instruction can best meet the needs of each student. When
implemented within an equitable multi-level system of support, the standards can help to ensure that every child will graduate
college and career ready.

Wisconsin Standards for Science


What is Science Education?
Wisconsin defines science as an academic discipline encompassing the study of the natural world. Our science standards also
include engineering applications, where science understanding informs problem-solving and design thinking within the human-
built world. Engineering ideas encompass the interactions of science, technology, and society. The standards outlined here
provide an important foundation to prepare students for post-secondary education, careers, and community involvement.
Science Education in Wisconsin
Science drives job growth and innovation throughout the economy and society. Demand for healthcare and other science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) based careers exceed other occupation categories, and this growth is
projected to continue. The need for science education integrated with design thinking is increasing because all students will need
some foundational knowledge in science and engineering to be future-ready problem solvers, regardless of their occupational
path. Being competent citizens in a world of abundant information (and misinformation) requires strong scientific thinking skills.
These standards articulate end-of-grade level expectations. Some students - including students who receive special education
services through an Individualized Education Program (IEP), students with gifts and talents, and English language learners - may
benefit from additional supports or challenges. Some barriers to learning and engagement can be minimized through Universal
Design for Learning (UDL). In addition, learning can be personalized through collaboration between educators, school staff,
families, and students.
At the elementary level, science content and concepts can be integrated throughout the curriculum, but these standards require
that students also have opportunities to engage in rigorous scientific investigation and argumentation from evidence. Teachers
can effectively use science concepts and practices in instruction to develop foundational skills for secondary science. Research
suggests that significant aspects of a scientific or STEM identity are formed by the end of the elementary years, making effective
instruction through these grade levels critical (Dewitt, et al., 2010).
Wisconsin’s Vision for Science
The Wisconsin vision for science learning is shaped by Wisconsin practitioners and experts, and is informed by work at the
national level and in other states. The overarching goal for science is to work together to create a scientifically literate populace.
Wisconsin’s vision for K-12 science learning states that:
         “[By] the end of 12th grade, all students have some appreciation of the beauty and wonder of science; possess sufficient
         knowledge of science and engineering to engage in public discussions on related issues; are careful consumers of
Wisconsin Standards for Science                                                                                                       8


         scientific and technological information related to their everyday lives; are able to continue to learn about science
         outside school; and have the skills to enter careers of their choice, including (but not limited to) careers in science,
         engineering, and technology” (National Research Council, 2012).
Wisconsin’s Approach to Academic Standards for Science
With the release of the Wisconsin Standards for Science, Wisconsin science teachers have access to the foundational knowledge
and skills needed to educate students for college, career, and community readiness. Vetted by industry and education
professionals, these academic standards guide Wisconsin schools, teachers, and community partners toward development and
continuous improvement of world-class science courses.
Our standards built from the National Research Council’s (NRC’s) Framework for K-12 Science Education and the Next
Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013). A group of national experts across science disciplines and engineering,
along with science and engineering education, developed this framework and released it in 2012. Another group of experts,
including representatives of 26 states, took that framework and developed the NGSS. Further information about this process
can be found here. Several groups of Wisconsin educators provided feedback on multiple drafts of these standards. Based on
survey data, by 2016, at least 80% of districts across Wisconsin had adopted the NGSS as their science standards or were using
them to inform instruction in some way.
In 2017, Wisconsin educators, higher education experts, and industry professionals gathered to create the Wisconsin Standards
for Science (WSS), heavily using these national documents. Notably, while some wording changes were made here and there for
clarity, the core aspects of the WSS and the NGSS are the same. Districts can choose to solely the NGSS in place of the WSS and
expect that students will be well-prepared for the Wisconsin Forward Exam.
Like the NGSS, the Wisconsin Standards for Science include three main dimensions:
     •   Crosscutting Concepts – big ideas of science that provide lenses for viewing phenomena and understanding problems in
         the world around us, and which apply across all areas of science and engineering;
     •   Science and Engineering Practices – the skills required for the work done in science;
     •   Disciplinary Core Ideas – content understanding across the disciplines of life science, physical science, earth and space
         science, and engineering.
Wisconsin Standards for Science                                                                                                    9


Critically, these three dimensions are not meant to be taught in isolation. The standards are formed as instruction and learning
integrate them into “three-dimensional learning” that requires students to use all three to make sense of phenomena and solve
relevant problems.
The Wisconsin Standards for Science may be taught through a variety of classes and experiences. Each district, school, and
program area should determine the means by which students meet these standards. The Forward Exam at grades 4 and 8, ACT
Aspire at grades 9 and 10, and the ACT + Writing at grade 11 all provide useful large-scale information about learning related to
these standards. Classroom and school/department-level assessments connected to these standards are other important
aspects of the strategic assessment system that should be in place to fully gauge students’ science learning and support
individual students.
Standards Structure
All new Wisconsin standards are formatted from a common template to support educators in reading and interpreting them. The
specific discipline is stated at the top of each template. In the case of the science standards, there are three sections
(dimensions): crosscutting concept standards, science and engineering practice standards, and disciplinary core ideas (science
and engineering content). The three sections are color coded. Crosscutting concept standards are in green. Science and
engineering practice standards are in blue. Content standards are in orange. Every series of lessons should integrate these three
dimensions; they should not be taught or assessed in isolation.
Structure, Development, and Language of the Science Content Standards
The science content standards are further divided into disciplinary core ideas in life science (LS); physical science (PS); earth and
space science (ESS); and engineering, technology, and science applications (ETS). The figure below shows a sample standard from
the life science content area:
The code, “Standard SCI.LS1” is translated as follows: Science.Life Science Content Area Standard 1—which pertains to the
content area of structures and processes.
Wisconsin Standards for Science                                                                                                     10


The standards statements for content (disciplinary core ideas), practices, and crosscutting concepts are based on the
foundational phrase, “Students use science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and an understanding of content to
make sense of phenomena and solve problems.” Depending on the standard, the specific crosscutting concept, practice, or
content topic will appear in bold. In this case, the content of “structures and processes (on a scale from molecules to organisms),”
is italicized as it is the focus of the following section (LS1).
These standards statements emphasize students should be engaging in three-dimensional science learning from kindergarten
through grade 12, meaning they learn the content by engaging in the scientific and engineering practices while using the
perspectives of the crosscutting concepts to think like scientists.
Each content standard statement is further divided into learning priorities and performance indicators. In the figure below, the
code SCI.LS1.A refers to learning priority A of life science standard statement 1. Each standard statement has from 1-5 learning
priorities, which are subareas of the overarching content, practice, or crosscutting concept on the page. The performance
indicators provide a learning progression from grade band to grade band for each learning priority. Notably, these disciplinary
core ideas statements only become “performance indicators” when placed in the context of the standards statement at the top
of each page: “Students use science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and an understanding of [insert content] to
make sense of
phenomena and solve
problems.” Each
performance indicator is
associated with a
suggested grade level
within the elementary
school grade bands; the
code for the
performance indicator
notes the appropriate
grade level at the end.
For example, SCI.LS1.A.1
refers to the
developmentally
appropriate
Wisconsin Standards for Science                                                                                                   11


understanding of structure and function for the K-2 grade band, and it is suggested that this content be learned in grade 1. These
grade levels are recommended to support consistency across the state, state standardized assessment preparation, and student
transfers between districts. With local control, districts can assign performance indicators to elementary grade levels that best
fit their needs.
Performance indicators for the middle school and high school grade bands are not associated with suggested grade levels, so the
grade level codes for these grade bands are “m” for middle school and “h” for high school. Some districts may choose an
integrated course format while others may choose to organize classes by discipline. There is not a recommended method.
Appendix K of the Next Generation Science Standards includes several ideas for structuring secondary science courses.
The high school standards include content, skills, and ways of thinking (i.e. disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering
practices, and crosscutting concepts), forming the core learning for all students. Advanced and elective science coursework
should move beyond the content noted here, though the practice and crosscutting concept standards should remain an integral
part of instruction.
It bears repeating that all standards statements have a similar structure with a blank that is filled by a specific grade level
disciplinary core idea from each learning priority. The performance indicators should be read as appropriately filling in the
overarching standards statement at the beginning of each section. For example, performance indicator SCI.LS1.A.1 can be read
as “Students use science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and an understanding that all organisms have
external parts that they use to perform daily functions to make sense of phenomena and solve problems.” When considered
within this three-dimensional framework, performance indicators provide a measurable component(s) for educators to use in
assessing student learning.
Some learning priorities boxes are intentionally left blank where it is not developmentally appropriate to teach a particular
science topic at that grade level.
It is important to note that there are no performance indicators listed for Four-Year-Old Kindergarten (4K). Our committee
suggests that educators use the Wisconsin Model Early Learning Standards to guide their work as they take advantage of the
natural connections to science that come up daily in an effective 4K experience. Some suggestions for 4K teachers include
supporting student experiences by encouraging students to ask questions and make observations as they play. 4K classes in
which teachers ask, “What did you notice?” “What do you wonder?” “What does this remind you of?” and “What does it feel like,
sound like, smell like, taste like, look like?” are more likely to come alive with authentic exploration. Such exploration and
wondering allows young children opportunities to figure things out and develop their own explanations as they interact with
their world.
Wisconsin Standards for Science                                                                                                   12


As stated earlier, these standards are designed to encourage instruction and learning that is “three dimensional,” i.e., includes
content taught through engagement in science and engineering practices in the context of crosscutting concepts. This three
dimensionality is a new means of doing business in the world of science education. The standards documents include
performance indicators that are provided as examples of ways to weave together particular content, practices, and modes of
thinking for the purpose of assessing student learning in a three dimensional context. With the exception of the ETS3 standards,
which were developed in Wisconsin, these example performance indicators come from the Next Generation Science Standards.
While these performance indicators provide guidance for the development of the 4th and 8th grade Forward Exam, they are not
meant to dictate curriculum and instruction. That development process should be guided by local leaders discussing how to best
connect the three dimensions based on local instructional preferences and students’ needs. Groups of science educators may
wish to create their own three dimensional performance indicators. See the figure below for the K-2 LS1 examples.
The statements are coded to indicate grade levels and the associated content standard. For example, the performance indicator
K-LS1-1 was created as an example of a kindergarten (K) indicator associated with standard LS1. To assist in labeling and
communication, the number at the end specifies that this is kindergarten sample performance indicator number 1.
Structure, Development, and Language of the Crosscutting Concepts Standards
There are seven crosscutting concepts standards built from Appendix G of the Next Generation Science Standards. These
crosscutting concepts are lenses through which scientists and engineers view phenomena and problems. Thus, they should form
the basis for the types of questions students ask and the analysis students do as they engage in authentic professional practice to
understand core science ideas. The standards page starts with a foundational, three-dimensional phrase, and each performance
indicator should be imbedded into this phrase. For instance, the example below states, “Students use science and engineering
practices, disciplinary core ideas, and patterns to make sense of phenomena and solve problems.” For a K-2 teacher, they would
further put their specific crosscutting concept statement into this sentence, so it would read, “Students use science and
Wisconsin Standards for Science                                                                                                   13


engineering practices and disciplinary core ideas to recognize that patterns in the natural and human designed world can be
observed, used to describe phenomena, and used as evidence. Therefore, every performance indicator statement in each grade
band would be read within this phrase, taking the place of the segment in bold. The coding of the crosscutting concepts
performance indicators follows the same pattern as the content standards (disciplinary core ideas), with one exception. Since the
crosscutting concept (CC) standards are not divided into separate “learning priorities,” the codes have one fewer numerical part.
A sample (CC1: Patterns) is shown in the figure below.
Structure, Development, and Language of the Science and Engineering Practice Standards
There are eight science and engineering practice standards built from Appendix F of the Next Generation Science Standards. These
practice standards detail the work of scientists and engineers. They suggest the types of skills students should be using as they
Wisconsin Standards for Science                                                                                                   14


learn core concepts and how to think like scientists and engineers. Each standard is further divided into learning priorities and
performance indicators. The standards page starts with a foundational, three-dimensional phrase, and each performance
indicator should be read as part of this phrase. For example, the standard below states, “Students ask questions and define
problems, in conjunction with using crosscutting concepts and disciplinary core ideas, to make sense of phenomena and solve
problems.” Like the above standards dimensions, each performance indicator statement would be read within this phrase, using
the grade-level statement in place of the segment in bold. The science and engineering practices are not intended as the focus of
a stand-alone lesson or unit, but should be integrated with the other two dimensions in the course of science instruction. The
coding of the science and engineering practice standards statements, learning priorities, and performance indicators follows the
same pattern as the content standards with one exception: The performance indicators for K-2 and 3-5 are identified by grade
band and not grade level, as is done with the disciplinary core ideas. A sample is shown in the figure below.
Wisconsin Standards for Science                                                                                                   15

Science: Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCI) — Life Science 1 (LS1) – Structures and Processes
Standard SCI.LS1: Students use science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and an understanding of
structures and processes (on a scale from molecules to organisms) to make sense of phenomena and solve problems.
Reminder: Throughout the Life Science section, the individual disciplinary core ideas in the boxes only become performance indicators when

                           molecules may combine with other elements to form amino acids and other large carbon-based molecules.
                           HS-LS1-7. Use a model to illustrate that cellular respiration is a chemical process whereby the bonds of food
                           molecules and oxygen molecules are broken and the bonds in new compounds are formed resulting in a net transfer of

                           HS-LS4-2. Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from four
                           factors: (1) the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a
                           species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3) competition for limited resources, and (4) the proliferation of
                           those organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce in the environment.
                           HS-LS4-3. Apply concepts of statistics and probability to support explanations that organisms with an advantageous
                           heritable trait tend to increase in proportion to organisms lacking this trait.

Science: Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCI) — Physical Science 1 (PS1) – Matter and Its Interactions
Standard SCI.PS1: Students use science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and an understanding of
matter and its interactions to make sense of phenomena and solve problems.
Reminder: Throughout the Physical Science section, the individual disciplinary core ideas in the boxes only become performance indicators
when inserted into the sentence above, in this case replacing the overall topic words, “matter and its interactions.” For example with PS1.A.2,
it would read, “Students use science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and an understanding that matter exists as different
substances that have different observable properties to make sense of phenomena and solve problems.”

                           MS-PS2-2. Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the change in an object’s motion depends on the sum of the
                           forces on the object and the mass of the object.
                           MS-PS2-3. Ask questions about data to determine the factors that affect the strength of electric and magnetic forces.
                           MS-PS2-4. Construct and present arguments using evidence to support the claim that gravitational interactions are
                           attractive and depend on the masses of interacting objects.

                           between objects exerting forces on each other even though the objects are not in contact.
 Grades 9-12               HS-PS2-1. Analyze data to support the claim that Newton’s second law of motion describes the mathematical
                           relationship among the net force on a macroscopic object, its mass, and its acceleration.
                           HS-PS2-2. Use mathematical representations (qualitative and quantitative) to support the claim that the total
                           momentum of a system of objects is conserved when there is no net force on the system.
                           HS-PS2-3. Apply scientific and engineering ideas to design, evaluate, and refine a device that minimizes the force on a
                           macroscopic object during a collision.
                           HS-PS2-4. Use mathematical representations (qualitative and quantitative) of Newton’s law of gravitation and
                           Coulomb’s law to describe and predict the gravitational and electrostatic forces between objects.
                           HS-PS2-5. Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that an electric current can produce a magnetic field
                           and that a changing magnetic field can produce an electric current.
                           HS-PS2-6. Communicate scientific and technical information about why the molecular-level structure is important in
                           the functioning of designed materials.

                           MS-ESS1-4. Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence from rock strata for how the geologic time scale is
                           used to organize Earth’s 4.6-billion-year-old history.
 Grades 9-12               HS-ESS1-1. Develop a model based on evidence to illustrate the life span of the sun and the role of nuclear fusion in
                           the sun’s core to release energy that eventually reaches Earth in the form of radiation.
                           HS-ESS1-2. Construct an explanation of the Big Bang theory based on astronomical evidence of light spectra, motion
                           of distant galaxies, and composition of matter in the universe.
                           HS-ESS1-3. Communicate scientific ideas about the way stars, over their life cycle, produce elements.
                           HS-ESS1-4. Use mathematical or computational representations to predict the motion of orbiting objects in the solar
                           system.
                           HS-ESS1-5. Evaluate evidence of the past and current movements of continental and oceanic crust and the theory of
                           plate tectonics to explain the ages of crustal rocks.
                           HS-ESS1-6. Apply scientific reasoning and evidence from ancient Earth materials, meteorites, and other planetary
                           surfaces to construct an account of Earth’s formation and early history.

engineering design to make sense of phenomena and solve problems.
Reminder: Throughout the Engineering, Technology, and the Application of Science section, the individual disciplinary core ideas in the boxes
only become performance indicators when inserted into the sentence above, in this case replacing the overall topic words, “engineering
design.” For example with ETS1.A.K-2, it would read, “Students use science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and an
understanding that a situation that people want to change or create can be approached as a problem to solved through engineering to make sense of
phenomena and solve problems.” Additionally, these engineering ideas are meant to be integrated with related science learning, not taught in
isolation.

                       Section IV
          Disciplinary Literacy:
Literacy for Learning in Science


What is Disciplinary Literacy?
Scientists and engineers have unique ways of accessing and communicating information through specialized language and text
specific to science and within the various disciplines of science and engineering. Students benefit from educators who
understand science and engineering practices in order to link language skills to this complex content. Disciplinary literacy in
science focuses on the unique ways that scientists and engineers interact with texts such as data sheets and journal articles.
In Wisconsin, disciplinary literacy is defined as the confluence of content knowledge, experiences, and skills merged with the
ability to read, write, listen, speak, think critically, and perform in a way that is meaningful within the context of a given field.
Scientists and other STEM professionals have unique ways of accessing and communicating information. Students generally do
not gain those skills in an English course. They benefit from explicit instruction by someone who understands scientific practices
in order to link language skills to this complex content. For example, having students read a text and identify main points and key
vocabulary is not disciplinary literacy; disciplinary literacy in science focuses on the unique ways that scientists interact with
texts.
The Wisconsin Academic Standards for Literacy in All Subjects are connected to each set of content-specific standards to guide
educators as they strive to help students meet the literacy challenges within each particular field of study. This national effort is
referred to as disciplinary literacy.
Disciplinary literacy is important in ALL courses and subjects at all grade levels. Therefore, the Wisconsin Academic Standards for
Literacy in All Subjects provide standards for cross-discipline literacy in all disciplines and every grade level K-12. This literacy
focus must begin as soon as children have access to formal education and continue intentionally as college and career readiness
goals advance for all children in Wisconsin.
Elementary classroom teachers build the foundational literacy skills necessary for students to access all learning. Additionally,
they develop content-specific literacy skills to read, write, listen, speak, and think critically in each discipline beginning at an
early age. The applicable K-5 standards help educators in Wisconsin build a ladder of skills and dispositions that lead to
accelerated achievement across disciplines.
Why is Disciplinary Literacy Important?
The modern global society, of which our students are a part, requires postsecondary learning. An analysis of workforce trends by
Georgetown University economist Anthony Carnevale and his colleagues found that likely 65 percent of all job openings in 2020

language and thinking processes of science, and they must be supported by an expert guide, their
teacher (Carnegie Report, 2010).
A focus at the elementary level on foundational reading, when expanded to include engaging experiences connected to
informational texts, vocabulary, and writing for content-specific purposes, builds background knowledge and skills in each
discipline. This increases opportunities for success as students approach more rigorous content in those disciplines (Alliance for
Excellent Education, 2011). Notably, reading and writing about science, which are most often only literacy experiences, cannot
substitute for hands-on experiences in science investigation, which is critical from K through 12, not only secondary courses.
Reading, writing, speaking, listening, and critical thinking must be integrated into each discipline across all grades so that all
students gradually build knowledge and skills toward college and career readiness. Collaboration among institutes of higher
education, CESA Statewide Network, districts, schools, teachers, and family and community will guide the implementation of the
standards in Wisconsin.
All Wisconsin standards require educators to support literacy in each classroom across the state. In science that specifically
relates to learning the disciplinary literacy of scientists and engineers, not general literacy instruction such as grammar or
reading comprehension. Since the impact of this disciplinary literacy effort is significant, it is essential that resources and
supports be accessible to all educators. To build consistent understanding, DPI convened a statewide Disciplinary Literacy
Leadership Team in 2011 comprised of educators from many content areas and educational backgrounds. This team was
charged with examining standards, identifying the needs in the field for support, and gathering materials and resources to
address those needs.

    6. Use technology and digital media strategically and capably.
    7. Come to understand other perspectives and cultures.
Academic learning begins in early childhood and develops across all disciplines.
Each discipline has its own specific vocabulary, text types, and ways of communicating. Children begin learning these context-
and content-specific differences early in life and continue through high school and beyond. While gardening, small children
observe the form and function of a root, stem, leaf, and soil; or measure, mix, and blend while baking a cake. School offers all
students opportunities to develop the ability to, for example, think like a scientist, write like a historian, critique like an artist,
problem solve like an engineer, or analyze technological advances like a health care technician. As literacy skills develop,
educators gradually shift the responsibility for reading, writing, listening, speaking, and critical thinking to students through
guided supports in both individual and collaborative learning experiences.
Content knowledge is strengthened when educators integrate discipline-specific literacy into teaching and learning.
Educators help students recognize and understand the nuances of a discipline by using strategies that “make their thinking
visible.” They promote classroom reading, writing, listening, speaking, and critical thinking using authentic materials that support
the development of content-specific knowledge. They guide students through these complex texts by using strategies that

build a blog that contains their recent marketing venture, they use specific literacy skills and
strategies to solidify learning. Students need these opportunities over time to develop the precise and complex reading, writing,
listening, speaking, and critical thinking skills demanded in today’s careers.
Students demonstrate their content knowledge through reading, writing, listening, and speaking as part of a content-literate community.
Students who are literate in a particular discipline are able to successfully read, write, and speak about that discipline and can
listen to and think critically as others communicate in that community. Performance tasks that allow students to present the
complexity of a content area in a way that is meaningful to the field become authentic approaches to assessing mastery within a
discipline. Such tasks empower students to discover the real-world connections across disciplines and to actively participate in
communities of discipline-literate peers.
What research and resources are available?
The Wisconsin Academic Standards for Literacy in All Subjects reflect the importance of literacy in both the oral and written
language and in both productive (speaking and writing) and receptive (listening and reading) discourse. Clearly, critical and
precise thinking are required to develop all of these specific strategies and skills. The standards also address the learning and
functioning of language in a technological, media-driven world because the language that we use is selective depending upon the
context of the conversation.
The following section offers relevant research and resources to support professional learning in reading, writing, speaking,
listening, and language across disciplines. Collegial conversation and learning, both cross-discipline and within-discipline, will
help make the Wisconsin Academic Standards more applicable to schools and districts and will address the needs of unique
programs within those contexts. A collection of online resources will continue to develop as support materials emerge.

Reading Connections
While early reading focuses on learning that letters make sounds and that words carry meaning, reading quickly develops to a
point where the message taken from text depends on what the reader brings to it. The Carnegie Report, Reading in the Disciplines
(2010), describes this phenomenon:
         Therefore, a musician reading a journal article that describes concepts in music theory will take more information
         away from the text than a music novice because of their knowledge and experience in music. As well, an individual
         who spends a significant amount of time reading automotive manuals will more easily navigate a cell phone
         manual because of familiarity with that type of text.
A chart excerpted from the Carnegie Report (2010) details a few of the generic and more discipline-specific strategies that
support students as they attempt to comprehend complex text. While the generic strategies pertain across content areas,
discipline-specific ones must be tailored to match the demands of the content area.
Both generic and discipline focused strategies and knowledge must be applied to the comprehension and evaluation of:
    • textbooks
    • journal and magazine articles
    • historically situated primary documents
    • full-length books
    • newspaper articles
    • book chapters
    • multimedia and Digital Texts

Altieri (2011) is a guide for discipline-specific literacy at the elementary level and offers strategies to balance the demands of
literacy while continuing to make content count and help students meet the reading, writing, speaking and listening demands of
the content areas as they advance in school.

a base of content-specific knowledge while developing skills to read increasingly complex text.
Wisconsin uses a three-part model for text complexity, considering qualitative, quantitative, and reader-and-task demands (see
https://dpi.wi.gov/reading/professional-learning/text-complexity for more information). In addition, a well-developed collection
of complex texts carefully considers representation and diversity, including diversity in the creators and topics of texts.
Writing Connections
The Wisconsin Academic Standards for Literacy in All Subjects call for emphasis on three types of writing: narrative, informational,
and argument. Writing that presents a logical argument is especially appropriate to discipline-specific work since credible
evidence differs across content areas. The ability to consider multiple perspectives, assess the validity of claims, and present a
point of view is required in argumentative writing. These thinking and communication skills are “critical to college and career
readiness.”
The study found writing to learn was equally effective for all content areas in the study (social studies, math, and science) and at
every grade (4-12).
Note on range and content of student writing
The Wisconsin Academic Standards for Literacy in All Subjects require that students “write routinely over extended time frames
(time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of discipline-
specific tasks, purposes, and audiences.” This breadth and depth of writing ensures students are able to flexibly select a format to
meet the needs of a specific audience and purpose. This is accomplished through significant amounts of time dedicated to varied
writing.

     • Listening carefully to questions posed is a specialized skill that debate facilitators develop.
     • Scientists learn to listen for bias in the perspectives presented by peers to determine the reliability of scientific outcomes.
     • Artists have very specialized and specific ways of speaking about the many aspects of a piece.
A policy brief from the Alliance for Excellent Education, Engineering Solutions to the National Crisis in Literacy describes “a staircase
of literacy demands” and emphasizes the importance of a progressive development of language and literacy over time.
The conceptual understanding of “functions” in mathematics may begin to develop in elementary school in its simplest form. As
the concept develops over the years, students will use the word “function” in a meaningful way when speaking and writing to
describe the mathematical concept they apply. When educators explicitly connect a mathematical term to its application and
repeatedly expose students to the concept connected to the term, a specialized language becomes second nature to the
mathematics classroom.
Skills in determining or clarifying the meaning of words and phrases encountered, choosing flexibly from an array of strategies,
and seeing an individual word as part of a network of other words that, for example, have similar denotations but different
connotations, allow students to access information and support their own learning.

Literacy in Multiple Languages
Increasing economic, security, cross-cultural, and global demands underscore the value of literacy in more than one language.
Students who think, read, write, and communicate in multiple languages are an asset to our own country and can more easily
interact and compete in the world at large.
English learners in our classrooms face significant challenges as they add a new language and work to grasp content at the same
rate as their English-speaking peers. In a report to the Carnegie Corporation, Double the Work: Challenges and Solutions to
Acquiring Academic Literacy for Adolescent English Language Learners (2007), researchers found that a focus on academic literacy is
crucial for English language learners’ success in school. In their description of academic literacy, they include reading, writing,
and oral discourse that:
    • varies from subject to subject;
    • requires knowledge of multiple genres of text, purposes for text use, and text media;
    • is influenced by students’ literacies in context outside of school; and
    • is influenced by students’ personal, social, and cultural experiences.
The needs of our English learners are addressed when we embed disciplinary literacy strategies into our subject area teaching.
These high impact strategies and skills allow English language learners and all students to more readily access content
knowledge and connect it to the prior knowledge they bring to the classroom. When educators take the initiative to understand
and embed these strategies and skills, they offer additional opportunities for success to all of our students.
