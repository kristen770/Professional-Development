                                                            ORGANIZATION OF STANDARDS
The 2018 Science Extended Standards are an extension of the 2016 Science Standards which were informed by A Framework for K-12 Science Education
(National Research Council, 2012), the Next Generation Science Standards (National Academies Press, 2013), and the unique needs of Wyoming. They are dis-
tinct from prior science standards in that they integrate three dimensions of learning within each standard and have intentional connections across standards,
grade bands, and subjects. The three dimensions are crosscutting concepts, disciplinary core ideas, and science and engineering practices.
